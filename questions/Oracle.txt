Oracle 2 years Experienced  Hyderabad  location. There were 3 tech round and 1 director round.
Round 1 
1: If there is sudden cut off in power and you have to save the clients important data from a web browser, so that it can be recovered , how would you do that?
2: Difference between Object,Class,Reference with example.
3: what is singleton class design your own.
4: You have records of employee name and salary.You have to sort the records on the basis of employee salary,if same then by  employee name.
Round 2 
1: You have three types of details distance between two cities ,road condition between two cities and traffic details between two cities. Priority of traffic>distance>road condition.
You will be given source and destination, write a code to find the best path.
2: you have 2 methods isDirectory and isFile,code to count total number of files.
    Then count size of top 10 files, then is it possible to find top 10 files without scanning all the     directories.
Round 3
1: Project Discussion.
2: Convert sorted array to balanced binary search tree.
3: Given array of characters shuffle it so that no similar character are beside to each other.
4: 25 horses puzzle.
Round 4
1: why you are switching your current job?
2: Why Oracle?
3: State any two unique ideas on which we can build a mobile app.
4: CTC discussion.



I attended interview for Java developer for 3 years experience. 
First round was written for 40 mint which consist of 30 question. Out of 30,  25 questions were from Java fundamentals and 5 simple aptitude. Do not remember questions exactly but all were simple and easy. 
After that 2 face to face interviews
1st round face to face
1. They ask tell me about yourself
2. Employee and department table design based on some condition like one employee can belong to more than one department then one employee can belong to one department only like this 5-6 question
3. There is an array [1,2,5,4,8,3] and sum = 7. Find all the sub set array such that sum of elements is 7
Example [1+2+4]=7, [2+5]=7, [4+3]=7
4 There are two array array1 = [a, f, h, k, m, o, s, r …….. and so on], array2 = [h, k, m. o]. Check that array1 contain array2 or not 



Round 1:
	– Group anagrams from list of strings
	– Right view of binary tree
Round 2:
	– Given Binary tree. Find whether its BST
	– Singleton & Observer design patterns
	– Sorted array to balanced BST
	– Get frequency count of elements of sorted array
	– Sort strings by length
Round 3:
	– Print LinkedList elements in reverse order
	– Log file is given with some function start and ending statements. Determine whether its valid log file i.e. all statements properly logged or not ?
	– XML file validation
	– Managerial Questions
Round 4:
	– Questions on Threads, HashMap, etc
	– find a number between 1 and 100, that generates longest series using following rules:
		if n is odd, next n = 3n + 1
		if n is even, next n = n/2
		if n == 1, terminate
Round 5:
	– Managerial questions
