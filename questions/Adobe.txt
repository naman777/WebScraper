I recently interviewed at Adobe, Noida office and got the offer. I had 1-year work experience.
It was a standard process comprising of an aptitude and technical test on Hackerrank. It’s the same every time. You can have a look at the test in previous archives. 
Interviews at Noida Office
Gave an answer using the difference in length of LLs and wrote the code which handled all the cases.
Note. Make sure you write code which handles all the test cases especially the boundary ones.
Solved it using basic pythagoras theorem.
It was weird that he asked only one question.
This round was a tricky one.
He then asked me about how we heapify individual elements, etc. and how heap sort works.
Basically, he wanted me to answer that we do not heapify elements from (n-1)/2 till n which decreases the time complexity from nlogn which I answered in the end.
Where does b point to?
Now this question was related to Big endian and little endian as in he wanted me to ask if the architechture is little endian or big endian. I told him I did not know about this.
After this question, I told him that I am from Mechanical background and I did not know much about computer architecture. He was a little shocked and skipped the OS questions. Lucky me!!!
Gave the algorithm using XOR.
First gave the approach using Heap. Put all the elements of an array in a min heap and extract k times. But he was interested in a better approach.
Answered using a quick select algorithm (modified quicksort).
He told me there is a more optimized approach to the selection of pivot elements using order statistics. I did not know the order statistics method but he was quite satisfied with the basic quick select algorithm.
I wrote basic linear search code. Then he asked me how do you minimize the number of comparisons.
In the end he asked me if I had any questions regarding the role and all.
I would like to take a moment and thank GeeksforGeeks for helping me in my interview preparation. Cheers to you guys!!!



Online Written Test 
20 MCQ +  5 Coding Questions 
F2F 1
1. There are two sorted arrays . Find the median of array obtained by Merging these two arrays.
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/
2. Find Transpose of a Matrix.
3. Tell me about Garbage Collection . I told him about GC process and different types of GCs available. Then Interviewer asked about Mark and Sweep Algorithm.   
4. Fill 4 Lt using 5 Lt and 3 Lt Jars.
F2F 2
1.  There are tuples given  for each users of a  website (Si,Ei) where Si denotes the when the user entered the website and Ei denotes when the user exits the website .Find the maximum number of users active of website at any time duration.
2. Given an array that contains both positive and negative integers, find the product of the maximum product subarray
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maximum-product-subarray/
3. Rotate a Matrix clockwise by 90 degree. 
4. Puzzle : There are n Prisoners standing in a line with increasing height such that each prisoner can see the hat color of prisoners standing ahead of him but he cannot see his own hat color. Hats are of only two color , Red or Blue. Now each prisoner has to say his hat color. If he is right, he lives otherwise the Jailer will shoot him. Find the strategy to save maximum number of prisoners. 
5. 
We want to execute this class in Multi threaded environment such that each thread should have same initial value as 0 .
Ans: I told him to use ThreadLocal Variable and store i in it . Then we started discussing on Thread Local Variable and Java Memory Model. 
F2F3
1. There is a binary stream coming . You need to print true or false based on the fact whether the number formed is divisible by 5 or not. 
Hint:I used state machine
2. Print all subset of a Set . 
3. Implement Dictionary .
I used Ternary Search Tries.
4. What is Adapter Design Pattern . Give an Example and draw class diagram. 
F2F4 (Director Round- Telephonic) 
It was very short (15-20 mins). Comprised general discussion of my project , the internal architecture of framework i am using. Few Scalablity concepts. 



Round 1:
Q1. Implement memcpy function. How do you make compiler to give warning if user passes nomberOfBytes less then equal to zero.
Q2. Write code to multiply two matrix.
Q3. What is SIMD?
Q4. What are different IPCs mechanisam.
Q5. Find least common ancestor for N-ary tree, given pointer of two nodes. tree structure has parent pointer too.
Q6. what are the principles of Dynamic programming.
Round 2:
Q1. Design like/unlike feature of facebook, when some one uploads a photo.
       How do u notify to users who have already liked the photo.(Observer pattern)
       10 million users like the photo at the same time, how do you handle such scenario.
        Solution:(duplicate the photo instance in multiple servers based on load balance and do parallel reduction technique to do like++(lock like in each server) for each server and then broadcast the number of l         ikes to other servers )
Q2. Write code for inorder traversal of a tree. Recursive and iterative using stack.
Q3. Given a matrix of size nxn, how many ways are there to go from 0,0 to n-1,n-1. Both recursive and DP based solution.
Q4. Given a matrix of sise nxn and filled with 0s and 1s. you cant step into cell with zero. what is the shortest path to go from 0,0 to n-1,n-1. Both recursive and DP based solution. 
Round 3: (Director Round)
Q1. Why do we need copy constructor?
Q2. Write method signature for copy constructor.
Q3. Write method signature for operator overloading.
Q4. Implement a stack which supports push and pop function. Write production level code.
 some question related to work and behavioral questions.
Round 4:
Q1.There are two players A & B.
Pots of gold are arranged in a line, each containing some gold coins (the player can see how many gold coins are there in each gold pot – perfect information).  They get alternating turns in which the player can pick a pot from one of the ends of the line.  The winner is the player which has highest number of gold coins at the end.
The objective is to maximize the number of gold coins collected by A, assuming B also plays optimally.  A starts the game. You need to tell the final state of both the player.
Q2. Can we do array[i]=i++;



Adobe visited Hyderabad for a recruitment drive. Interviews were held in Novotel convention center.
F2f 1(1.5 hours)
F2f 2(1.5 hours)
There were few other questions related to DS algo asked in this round for which he asked me only the logic and did not ask me to code, I don’t remember all.
F2f 3(1.5 hours)

Director(30 mins)
The interview was held in a large conference hall with the table & chair been placed exactly in the center of the hall. He asked me the following questions:
Your aim is to prepare a schedule so that all courses are taught in the least time. I will appreciate if readers can answer their approaches in comments.
