Written Test:
1) 15 Aptitude Questions
2) 25 CS Fundamentals & Couple of output questions.
3) Coding Question: A thief trying to escape from a jail has to cross ‘N’ walls each with varying heights. He climbs ‘X’ feet every time. But, due to the slippery nature of those walls, every times he slips back by ‘Y’ feet. Now the input is given as (N, {H1, H2, H3,….Hn}, X, Y}. Calculate the total number of jumps required to cross all walls and escape from the jail.
F2F 1
1) Calculate the number of bits set to 1 in a binary number.
2) Unsorted array and a position ‘P’. Return the element that is likely to come to the given location upon sorting the array. Do it 0(n).
3) Many question regarding UNIX N/W programming. Doesn’t need to worry. If you know already is advantageous.
4) Shared memory, OS concepts, IPC mechanisms. Which among is the fastest IPC
F2F 2
1) Questions related to projects.
2) Given a big C program, point out various storage classes.
3) Explain the DS which is well suited to implement UNIX commands like PWD, LS, MKDIR, CD in an imaginary OS. No code required. Just the DS.
F2F 3
Entire round is dedicated to projects.
F2F 4:
With team manager: Why you want to switch. Explained the work. Which team you want to join.

B


After online HackerRank test 
1st round 
OS concept like virtual memory, types of memory, diff  between cache memory and main memory
Explain system call,
printf( ) how it will work?
C concepts – static variable VS Global variable, static global variable,  bit to hex , bit problems like set and swap bit of Integer , structure padding , volatile variable in depth , register variable
implement stack using queue. reverse a b int without using temp  variable.

2nd round
Work related questions. How NAND work in SSD? PCI protocol.
Type of library. How to link dynamic lib with driver test program ?
Library related questions. 


I got a call from Cisco Systems, Bangalore for Software Engineer role.
Total rounds: Hackerrank Test+ 3(Tech) + 1 (Managerial)
Hackerrank test is pretty standard Linked List, arrays, trees.

Round 1: Lot of questions from the resume, implement IPC on threads, Linked List questions, various IPCs, implement mutex locks.

Round 2: Networking questions, hub vs switch, significance of gateway, how to route packet from  one network to another, how would you build a packet when it goes from one network to another, bit manipulation

Round 3: Resume projects, hell lot of questions

Round 4: (Managerial) About the role, Why do you want to switch so early?, Mostly critical bug you have solved?, Why Cisco?
