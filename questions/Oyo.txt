Interview Round 1 
Interview Round 2
Interview Round 3


Round 0: I was given two problems to solve on paper (I wrote this as zero because it was not elimination round)
Round 1: Started with the introduction and then moved to following questions.
Round 2:  
Round 3:  
Round 4: Hiring Manager Round.


Following is the summary of the interview 
I have given the interview for OYO rooms for 5+ years Java Developer
Round1 :
Round 2:
Round 3 : 


Drive was conducted for software developer (6 months work ex)
Round 1: two written questions
– https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/candies/problem
– Check if a binary tree is subtree of another binary tree 

Round 2: F2F
 discussion of above 2 questions and
– Maximum Product Subarray
– Bottom View of Binary Tree
Round 3: F2F
– Given n numbers having k unique numbers and rest repeated where k<<n, sort them in time complexity less than O(nlogn)
– Sort array having numbers 1, 2, 3 only
– One thread (for printing 1, 100 times) vs 10 threads ( each printing 1, 10 times), which one is better and why ? advantages and disadvantages of both
– SQL query
(city_name, hotel_id) (hotel_id, hotel_name, date, hotel_price(per day))
find the name of the most expensive hotel in each city, where a hotel is considered most expensive if its average price of past one month > average price of others over the month
– Diamond inheritance problem in c++ and its solution
 


Round 1: Skype
Questions mostly on the technology you have worked on and algorithms.
Algo:  Find pair in BST which sums to X.
Round 2-5 (in person)
Round 2:
1. Implement stack using queue.
2. Left view of Binary Tree
And few Java concepts questions.
Round 3: 
1. Problem statement: Given a log file with sessionID, source pageId, destn pageID and Timestamp at which the page is visited. Identify all the pages that are linked and find the minimum count of the page to visit to reach P2 from P1 – Use Graph and apply BFS.
2. Design Tank Game – Identify all the classes, member variable, methods and relationship between each class. A design pattern can be applied.

Round 4:
1. Determine if there is a subset of the given set with sum equal to given sum
2. Implement LRU cache.
Questions on java concepts, design pattern and multithreading.
Round 5 (Hiring Manager):
Questions were mainly from resume, behavioral questions, design, and databases concept(join, query)
Note: You have to write the code on paper in each round.
