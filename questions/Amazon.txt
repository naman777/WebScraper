Hi, I was recently interviewed for SDE1 position for Amazon and got selected. I have 1.5 year experience in java. Geeksforgeeks helped me lot. I am very thankful to Geeksforgeeks team. Following were interview questions-
Two telephonic rounds followed by 5 F2F interviews.
Round 1 (Telephonic):
1. There is a dictionary already implemented. Write a method, which takes input String without space, to prints all subsets of the input string which is present in dictionary.
Example: Dictionary – a*
………….Input- aaabaa
………….Output- a,a,a,aa,aa,aaa,a,a,aa
2. There is a dictionary already implemented. Write a method , which takes input String without space, to replace the characters from the strings which are not present in dictionary with –
Example: Dictionary – a*
………….Input- aaabaa
………….Output- aaa_aa
Interviewer was cool. Did not code properly (lots of bugs were in code), but gave good approach for first question. For second question solution sent in a mail.
Round 2 (Telephonic):
1. Write a program to remove duplicates from array of prime numbers.
2. Write a program to return nearest elements from a binary search tree for input element.
This round was very good. Interviewer was very happy with my approach for both questions. Code did not have big bug.
Round 1 (F2F- Problem Solving and coding):
1. Tell me about yourself.
2. Write a program to find top 10 elements on an array of integers.

2.Given 2 strings str1 and str2. What is the efficient way to navigate from str1 to str2? The constraints are i) a string can be changed to another string by changing only one character. ii) all the intermediate strings must be present in dictionary. If not possible, return “not possible to navigate from str1 to str2”. (pre-processing is allowed and enough memory is available). for example: str1 = feel and str2 = pelt, then the navigation is feel -> fell -> felt -> pelt (Hint: Graph)

Time and space complexity must for all questions
Start from brute force and go to optimized solution.
All edge cases are to be covered in code?
Think out loud all the time (so that even when questions are easy they will catch your thinking with greater importance)



I recently had interviews with Amazon.com, Bangalore.
Here’s my interview experience

6) Connect all the siblings node in a binary tree.
Follow up questions:
a) Now connect all the non-siblings nodes as well (basically connect all nodes at the same
level). ( cousins )
b) Now write a recursive solution of the same.
I took a long time in coming up with the recursive solution for this question, but eventually solved it.
For each question I was asked write production level code.



Interview 1: 
Before the interview began we were asked to solve 6 questions
In the first interview i was asked how i solved Q4) replace all spaces with ‘%20’ and Q6) nth node from the end of a linked list.
and then we discussed in details about a project I did with my previous employer.
and then He asked a few questions ->
Q1) Dynamic Programming | Set 21 (Variations of LIS) – GeeksforGeeks -> 1. Building Bridges: Consider a 2-D map with a horizontal river passing through its center. There are n cities on the southern bank with x-coordinates a(1) … a(n) and n cities on the northern bank with x-coordinates b(1) … b(n). You want to connect as many north-south pairs of cities as possible with bridges such that no two bridges cross. When connecting cities, you can only connect city i on the northern bank to city i on the southern bank.
Q2) Write a C program to print all permutations of a given string – GeeksforGeeks -> Print all permutations of a string
Q3) Given the arrival and departure time of various trains in a station. Calculate the minimum number of platforms required such that no train has to wait for another train to vacate the platform.
The question basically means calculate the maximum number of trains that would be present in the platform at any given time.
Answer
sort the arrival time and sort the departure time, keep a count initialized to 0. compare the first element of the arrival time with the first of departure, increase the value of count if the value at current Index at arrival is less than the value index at departure and increment the arrival index, and vice versa. Keep the maximum count that you see.

Round 2
Q1) given the x,y,z coordinates of a billion stars (basically the entire array can’t fit in the RAM) calculate the k closest.
Answer -> use a max heap that contains the k minimum distances.
Time-> n(log k)
then the question was changed to -> now that we have several computers which can combine to fit the entire set of stars, how will you then solve it?
Answer-> use selection algo (similar to step 1 of quick sort) to find the k closest stars in each of the computers. Time -> O(n) and then use the k in the those m computers to find the minimum k. One way is to sort all them individually. and then create a min heap to calculate k minimum.
O(k^2 log k)
Q2)  Symmetric Tree (Mirror Image of itself) – GeeksforGeeks -> How to check if the tree is the mirror of itself
Then the question was extended to a n-ary tree.
Answer -> Please read the above link before reading this answer– We create a the n ary tree like this->
then we have the number of children of each node as nodeName->child.size();
we use it to compare the first child of the node with the last child, 2nd with 2nd last and so on:

Round 3
Q1) Write a C code to evaluate an expression tree.
Answer-> It has to be done in a post order traversal method, since the value of the left subtree is independent of the right subtree.
Q2) Articulation Points (or Cut Vertices) in a Graph – GeeksforGeeks -> Check for Articulation points
Q3) Given a stream of number, like 1,3,5,4,6,9 print 1,3-6,9
Answer-> create a hash map that contains the value of the ending index of the previous sequence.
key is the number and the value is the index where it occurs.
when we get 4, we have to check for the index of 3 and 5. (One above and one below)
the value at 3 is 1 and 4’s index is 3, so they can’t be paired.
We then check for 5. 5’s index is 2 and 4’s is 3, since they are together, they can be paired.
and then we check for 3 again, 3’s index is 1 and 4’s index is 2-3, so they can match
We go on. I don’t think I answered the questions the way it was asked, but he seemed ok with the answer I gave.
Next he modified more to include distributed systems in it. And asked me if there were several systems which received the input in round robin manner, how would I implement the above algorithms. I had no idea about this.
After round 3, I was called by Amazon and told that my first two rounds were positive but round 3 wasn’t. Round 3 was the hiring manager round, and he wasn’t happy that I had little idea about RAID ( Standard RAID levels – Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia )
So I had another hiring manager round.
Round 4
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-a-pair-with-given-sum-in-bst/
Find a pair with a given sum in a bst
more questions on what happened in Round 3 and why I want to leave my current firm.
Round 5 (Bar Raiser)
Questions like
1) tell me a time when you had a different opinion than the rest of the team.
2) tell me a time when you were thinking that the problem is something else, but it turned out to be something else
3) tell me a time when your opinion were discarded.
4) tell me a time when you had to work on a very short notice.
Coding questions-
1) given that we can form packs of 6,9 and 20 pens. Given a number x, calculate if we can form combinations of packs to form those many pens. Eg 24 pens can be formed by having 2 packs of 9 pens and 1 of 6 and 23 pens can’t be formed.
Answer
Dynamic Programming with the recursive function
DP[i]=DP[i-6]||DP[i-9]||DP[i-20];
2) Design an escalator system. Which classes would you make, etc.
After Round 5, they didn’t find me a cultural fit so they conducted a Round 6.
Round 6
Questions like- tell me something about yourself,
a time when you helped someone
A time when you shared a different opinion from your manager.

Round 1:
Q-1 Given an array os 0s and 1s, and another input m, I was supposed to tell the longest continuous streak of 1s after flipping m 0s to 1s. E.g., Array is {1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1} m = 1 (which means I can flip ‘m’ one 0 to 1)
Answer: 6 (if we flip 0 at index 7, we get the longest continuous streak of 1s having length 6)
Q-2 Given N ropes of lengths L1, L2, L3, L4, …, LN. I had to join every rope to get a final rope of length L1 + L2 + … + LN.
However, I can join only two ropes at a time and the cost of joining the two ropes is L1 + L2. I was supposed to join ropes in such a way that the cost is minimum.
Round 2:
Q-3 Given a BST, I needed to serialize it and deserialize it. This essentially boiled down to generating the “traversal” string and getting the BST back from the traversal.
Q-4 There are two linked lists. Both linked lists have a single-digit number in their nodes. I needed to
treat this linked lists as a numbers and add them up and store the digits in a new linked list.
E.g., head -> 5 -> 6 -> 7-> 9
head -> 2-> 1 -> 1
Resultant linked list: head-> 5 -> 8-> 9-> 0 (5679 + 211 = 5890)
Round 3: Hiring Manager round
Q-5 Project discussion in detail. Most challenging problem, how did you solve it, had any disagreement with manager, how did you fix it etc.
Q-6 Given an array {2, 4, 6, 0, 1, 8, 1}, where each element represents the height of tower located at its index. I was supposed to tell how much maximum water can accumulate in this “valley” once it rains.
Round 4:
Q-7 Given the encoding rule:
A -> 0
B -> 1
C -> 2
…
K -> 10
…
Z -> 25
I was supposed to get the number of original strings possible given an encoded input.
E.g., Given input 10, two possible original strings are possible BA and K, the answer is 2.
Q-8 Given two trees, find out if the second tree is a “subtree” of the first one.
Answer: No (Tree 2 is not a subtree of Tree A)
Round 5: Engineering manager round
Q-8 Engineering Manager round, all behavioral, why do you want to leave the company, one challenging problem, how did you overcome it, your biggest failure etc. etc.



I recently had interviews with Amazon at Hyderabad for SDE 1. I had around 1 year and 9 months of experience.
Telephonic Interview :
It started with a brief introduction of mine and my work. Then he asked me a coding question
1) Given a linked list eg : 1->2->3->4->5->6, make the following changes    1->6->2->5->3->4
Easy but it was lengthy. Had to write production level code.
After 2-3 hours, I got an invitation for in house interview at Amazon campus:
Round 1 : Face 2 Face
It started with a discussion about my previous work and projects. After the discussion he asked the following technical questions:
1) Given a pre-order traversal, construct a binary search tree.
Simple solution. Asked me to code it.
2) Given an alien dictionary, find the order of the alphabets in the dictionary.
Only the approach was required. I explained him the approach and he was satisfied.
3) Connect n ropes with minimum cost
I was asked to write production level code for the above problem.
Round 2 : Face to Face
Again the interview started with a discussion about my projects and then he asked a technical question.
1) Given m sorted arrays with n elements, merge these arrays into one sorted array of size m*n
I did hear about this question before but never really saw the optimized solution so I gave a O(m*m*n) solution. He asked me to optimize it, but I wasn’t able to do so, hence he asked me to code the O(m*m*n) solution. I took a lot of time to code it as I wanted to handle all the edge cases. Finally I coded it. He didn’t find any issues but he asked me to make it better. And then I suggested using heaps to get the minimum of all the m arrays.
Lot of questions on why heap and why not BST. Asked me to prove it mathematically.
But he was satisfied once I gave the solution using heaps.
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-k-sorted-arrays/
Round 3 Bar Raiser : Telephonic
Discussion on my previous projects and asked some behavioral questions like why are you leaving your current company, conflicts with your manager etc
Technical questions:
1) Find the maximum element in an array which is first increasing and then decreasing
2) Find the Pythagoras triplet in an array
Gave an O(n3) solution then made it O(n2logn). He asked me to optimise it even further.
Finally came up with O(n2) solution
3) Given a very large binary number which cannot be stored in a variable, determine the remainder of the decimal equivalent of the binary number when divided by 3
I had no clue about this question. He gave me a hint, with which I was able to solve it. But later, he asked me to find the remainder for any number k. Again he gave a hint and I was able to solve it.
Basically when we append a digit to a binary number, the previous binary number gets doubled, hence the remainder also gets doubled. 
By keeping track of the remainder of the previous binary number, the current remainder can be determined.
Round 4 Hiring Manager: Face to Face
Behavioral questions along with some questions about my previous projects.
Then he gave me a technical question:
1) Given a number say ‘1234’, return the number in words i.e One thousand two hundred and thirty four
Was able to cover all the scenarios. He was satisfied with my approach
Suggestions:
Think loud and be confident. It’s okay if you don’t know the answer at first. They mostly see how you solve questions for which you don’t know the solution.
Thanks geeksforgeeks. You guys are doing an awesome job.



Round 1: It was a written round with three question.
Q1) Find a peak element. 
Q2) Top View of binary tree. 
Q3) Maximum difference between node and its ancestor in Binary Tree. 
Round 2 (F2F):
Q1) Given an array of distinct integers, find if there are two pairs (a, b) and (c, d) such that a+b = c+d, and a, b, c and d are distinct elements. If there are multiple answers, then print any of them. Expected complexity :  O(n2
Q2) Lowest Common Ancestor in a Binary Tree
In both the questions, they needed a proper working code covering every edge cases.
Round 3 (F2F):
Q1) If I am designing a media player and I want to store songs and play them in random order
a) What data structure will you use to store songs?
b) How will you select the next song to play in a way which prevents the same song being played in consecutive turn.
I spend some time and finally came up with the working solution.
Q2) Clone a binary tree with random pointers. 
(Hint: Use HashMap)
 
Round 4 (Telephonic) :
Q1) Tell me about yourself. Your current company, your role and responsibilities. Reason for leaving current company.
Q2) Maximum triangle path Sum : Starting from the top of a pyramid of numbers like below, you can walk down going one step on the right or on the left, until you reach the bottom row:

One of such walks is 55 -> 94 >- 30 -> 26. You can compute the total of the numbers you have seen in such walk, in this case it’s 205.
Your problem is to find the maximum total among all possible paths from the top to the bottom row of the triangle. In the little example above it’s 321.
Q3) Design your own Process Control Block(PCB).
Q4) Give me an example of a project that didn’t work out well?

I had around 1 year and 9 months of experience.
Telephonic Interview : 
It started with a brief introduction of mine and my work. Then he asked me a coding question
1) Given a linked list eg : 1->2->3->4->5->6, make the following changes    1->6->2->5->3->4
Easy but it was lengthy. Had to write production level code.
After 2-3 hours, I got an invitation for in house interview at Amazon campus:
Round 1 : Face 2 Face 
It started with a discussion about my previous work and projects. After the discussion he asked the following technical questions:
1) Given a pre-order traversal, construct a binary search tree.
Simple solution. Asked me to code it.
2) Given an alien dictionary, find the order of the alphabets in the dictionary.
Only the approach was required. I explained him the approach and he was satisfied. Here is the link to the code anyway:
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/given-sorted-dictionary-find-precedence-characters/
3) Connect n ropes with minimum cost
I was asked to write production level code for the above problem.
Round 2 : Face to Face
Again the interview started with a discussion about my projects and then he asked a technical question.
1) Given m sorted arrays with n elements, merge these arrays into one sorted array of size m*n
I did hear about this question before but never really saw the optimized solution so I gave a O(m*m*n) solution. He asked me to optimize it, but I wasn’t able to do so, hence he asked me to code the O(m*m*n) solution. I took a lot of time to code it as I wanted to handle all the edge cases. Finally I coded it. He didn’t find any issues but he asked me to make it better. And then I suggested using heaps to get the minimum of all the m arrays.
Lot of questions on why heap and why not BST. Asked me to prove it mathematically.
But he was satisfied once I gave the solution using heaps.
Round 3 Bar Raiser : Telephonic
Discussion on my previous projects and asked some behavioral questions like why are you leaving your current company, conflicts with your manager etc
Technical questions:
1) Find the maximum element in an array which is first increasing and then decreasing 
2) Find the Pythagoras triplet in an array
Gave an O(n3) solution then made it O(n2logn). He asked me to optimize it even further.
Finally came up with O(n2) solution.
3) Given a very large binary number which cannot be stored in a variable, determine the remainder of the decimal equivalent of the binary number when divided by 3
I had no clue about this question. He gave me a hint, with which I was able to solve it. But later, he asked me to find the remainder for any number k. Again he gave a hint and I was able to solve it.
Basically when we append a digit to a binary number, the previous binary number gets doubled, hence the remainder also gets doubled. 
By keeping track of the remainder of the previous binary number, the current remainder can be determined.
Round 4 Hiring Manager: Face to Face
Behavioral questions along with some questions about my previous projects.
Then he gave me a technical question:
1) Given a number say ‘1234’, return the number in words i.e One thousand two hundred and thirty four
Was able to cover all the scenarios. He was satisfied with my approach
Suggestions:
Think loud and be confident. It’s okay if you don’t know the answer at first. They mostly see how you solve questions for which you don’t know the solution.
Thanks geeksforgeeks. You guys are doing an awesome job.



1.       Given infinite sequence of number, how you will store it in a system. Find whether the given  sequence is palindrome or not. 
Ans: He suggested to store all the number in a linked list and then find Palindrome or not
2.       A) Find the path with given sum in a Binary tree from the root
B) Find the path with given sum in a Binary tree from any node in the tree.
3.       Print all possible balanced parenthesis.
4.       Implementation of publisher and subscriber design pattern.
5.       Find the given sum in unsorted array.



I am 1.5 year experienced guy, currently working in one good Product Based company in Whitefield,Bangalore. I have spent 1.2 years in my present company and previously, I spent 6 months in TCS Pune.
Recently, I got a chance to be interviewed by Amazon at Bangalore, through a referral (made friend from Facebook :p). I was preparing for Amazon from last 6-8 months from GeeksforGeeks.org. I must say, GeeksforGeeks is making life of people. I got an offer from Amazon by preparing from GeeksForGeeks.
Questions :
As I reached to 25th Floor of WTC, Brigade Gateway, we 25 people were asked to write code for these 3 questions on paper (OnSite Written Round) :
1. Two numbers are represented by 2 linkedlists. Find the resultant linkedlist represented as sum of these given linkedlists.
2. Given a number say 12345, find the immediate next number using the same digits, in this case 12354.
3. 3 points of a triangle are given. Find if given forth point lies inside or outside of the triangle.
F2F Round 1 :
1. Given a Hotel and checkin/Checkout time of visitors, find the maximum numbers of rooms required. (different version of Trains/Platform question)
2. Given sequentially placed boxes, each representing a number( which may be positive or negative), we need to select the numbers in order to have the maximum sum, having the constraint that if we seelct a given box, we cannot select adjacent box to it, but can select any other.
Solution : let the boxes positions be the indexes of array and their values as array values. then if we select value at index 0, we cannot select value at index 1, but can select from index 2,3,, and so on.so we can apply Dynamic programming here.
F2F round 2 (Hiring Manager Round):
HR called me and gave me some tips before this Interview(I must say Amazon Interview people are really cool and make the candidate feel comfortable). He told me listen the question carefully and answer perfectly as this interview matter a lot.
1. Asked about my experience and work in current company. (Discussion lasted for about 1 hour) as I explained in deep and he asked cross questions.
2. Given 2 numbers, add them without using any arithmetic operator.
Hint : Use Binary Operators (specifically ‘<<‘, ‘&’, ‘^’)
Gave answers to this question and he was really impressed.
(he was also very cool in nature)
 
F2F Round 3 : 
1. Discussion on my projects and work in current company.
2. Given a general stack, design an advanced DS, such that getMin(),getMax() happens in o(1). Many cross questions on this. about optimizations and all.
Then HR told me that all my interviews went well and they will call me for last round of Interview. 🙂

Last F2F round (Bar Raiser):
1. Given a file having many lines of text(words) and given a dictionary having an API function boolean isValid(String word), which will return true is a word passed to this function is valid word in dic.,and will return false if given passed argument is not a valid word in dic.
Now read the file and check if each word as well as all possible words from its L to R and R to L combinations, are valid words in dic. or not.
e.g. say first line in file is “My name is Gourav”, then in the word NAME, the possible valid words are NAME, AM(L to R), ME(L to R), MAN(R to L), AN(R to L).
I implemented this simple questions in java code and used Hashmap to avoid processing of already processed words.
2. Why Amazon ?
3. Extraordinary work done in company which was out of scope of your designation.

Recently, I got a chance to be interviewed by Amazon at Bangalore campus, through referral. I had 8 months of experience in a product based company and 5 months of Internship. 
1st Round Telephonic : There were two guys, started with a formal introduction. Question 1 : Given an array and a number say “Num1”. Find two numbers whose sum is equal to given number “Num1”. 
I told him first Brute Force solution then he asked the time complexity which i told him O(n^2). Then he asked me to optimize the solution and I gave a O(nlogn) solution using sorting. And at last I told him O(n) solution using Hashing. 
Question 2 : Given an array of stock prices . Determine the maximum profit one can get by buying and selling the stock(Similar to stack span problem). I told him brute force solution of O(n^2) then he asked me if you could give an optimized solution. I told him O(n) solution using stack but code got stuck on some of the test cases and he asked me to modify the code but i couldn’t as they were running out of time. They provided me a link to Colabedit(kind of google shared document) where i had to code.Production ready code was required. After 2 days I got call from Amazon saying that feedback was positive and they asked me to come for face to face interview at Amazon’s office. 
F2F Round 1 : Started with a brief introduction. Q1: Given a M*N matrix. you have to start from Index(0,0) and reach to Index(M-1,N-1) with maximum sum , given the constraint that you can only move right or down i.e if you are at index (i,j), you can only move to index(i,j+1) or to index(i+1,j) I gave recursive solution for this and there were a lot of discussion on various test cases. He asked me to optimize the code. I gave him Dynamic programming approach . He asked that have you done it before and i said no then he asked me to code it. I had no idea of the code as i haven’t done it before. i struggled to write the correct code 2-3 times and at last i wrote the correct code. Then he said to me i am done with the interview, Do you have any question for me and i asked two question. 
Production ready code was required. 
F2F Round2 : Again Started with a brief introduction and some project discussion. Q1: A question similar to LCA(Least Common Ancestor) of Tree and I gave the answer immediately as I have understood the question and didn’t ask any further clarification. Q2: Given some resources in the form of the linked list you have to cancel out all the resources whose sum up to 0(Zero) and return the remaining list. I gave the solution immediately but couldn’t handle some of the corner test cases then he asked me to modify the code accordingly. Then he asked me to write all the test cases for it and i did. For eg; given the resources like this : case 1 : 6 -6 8 4 -12 9 8 -8 It should return 9 as all others get canceled. In the above example lists which gets canceled : 6 -6 8 4 -12 8 -8 o/p : 9 case 2 : 4 6 8 -9 10 -9 o/p : 4 6 case 3 : 4 6 -10 8 9 10 -19 10 -18 20 25 O/P : 20 25 
F2F Round3 : Started with a formal introduction and BTW he was the same guy who took my telephonic interview. Q1) He asked me subset sum problem i.e; Given an array find the maximum sum contiguous subarray. I gave O(n) a solution for finding the maximum sum immediately after he asked the question as I knew the solution. Then he asked me to trace the code for some test cases and it passed. Then he asked me to find the starting and end index of the subarray and I modified the code and initially got wrong but after some modification, I got the code right. 
Q2) Sum of numbers represented by two linked list. And I gave the answer immediately after he finished the question. But I gave the soln for adding two linked list numbers starting from the beginning but he told me to add the numbers as we do in normal addition. And I gave that solution by reversing the linked list and then adding the numbers and finally reversed the resultant list. After 2-3 days I got a call from Amazon that I have cleared the rounds and they asked me to come for Hiring Manager Round. One of the interviewers gave me feedback that he mugged the answer as I gave the answer immediately after the interviewer asked the question as I came to know later which was a major setback for me. So one of the advice would be to all of you that Even though you know the answer pretends that you don’t know. Ask some clarification question, As they also observe your problem-solving skills with coding. 
Hiring Manager Round F2F : Started with some basic questions and then asked why do you want to leave your current company and then he asked code Of the Fibonacci series. I explained the Fibonacci series and then he asked me to code it. I wrote the code and traced some inputs. Then he had a meeting as I reached late there so he asked me to improve the code as he said there is some bug in the code and I did. After that, he asked me to write recursive code for it. Then he asked the time complexity of the code and I said Exponential. Then he asked me to prove it. I said sir I could do it using Master Theorem or using Mathematical Induction. But right now I remember none of them. Then he told me that you can do it without Master Theorem or MI. Then in my mind, it struck me as the Recursion Tree Method but at that time I didn’t have any idea of the recursion tree method as well. So I couldn’t tell him. This round wasn’t positive as I knew right after my interview. I got eliminated after this round.

Telephonic 
Production level code in any language was expected with unit test. Collabedit link was shared before interview  
Face to Face Round 1  
He explained the code-reviews, deployment, testing etc practices followed at Amazon. He gave a brief background/goals of the team for which i applied. 
Round 2  
Round 3  
Round 4  
 
 


I was interviewed in Delhi for SDE-I position in Kindle Frameworks Team at Amazon. I was working as a Project Lead in Samsung, Noida and had a total experience of 1 year 10 months in the Software Industry.
Round 1 : Written
Round 2 : Problem Solving (F2F)
Round 3 : Design and Data Structures (F2F)
The interviewer was highly impressed with my coding skills and shook hands with a sense of approval.
Round 4 : Hiring Manager (F2F)
The Hiring Manager introduced himself and told me that I’ve been doing really great till now. Then he grinned at me and said “ Lets hope you don’t mess it up in this round “ .
(1) Which Sorting Algorithm is the fastest and why would you prefer it over others ?
While telling the answer, I said in between “ If there would have been millions of numbers…… “ and he caught that specific word of mine “millions” and hence the next 2 questions found the way on their own.
Then he stood up and shook my hands with a broad smile and said “ Well Done Man ! ” and left.
Round 5 : Bar Raiser (F2F)
All credit goes to  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ team for providing such an inspirational and a brilliant platform for coders. Keep it up guys, Way to go !
Suggestion for other candidates interviewing at Amazon :
 
 



Round 1
Round 2
Round 3

Round 4



Amazon Off Campus Interview Experience(SDE-1, Experienced)
Round 1:
1) Tell me about yourself.
2) Trapping Rain Water : Giv­en n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/trapping-rain-water/
3)  Print left view of a binary tree.
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/print-left-view-binary-tree/
	Discussion : I gave two approaches one with DFS and other with level order traversal.
He asked to compare two approaches and implement the efficient one. 	DFS is the efficient one because in level order, you need to store all the nodes at each level, some of them may not be a part of the left view of BT.
Round 2:
1) Tell me about yourself.
2)  Find sum of n elements after kth smallest element in BST. Tree is very large, you are             not allowed to traverse the tree.
	 Discussion : Since the array traversal is not allowed so we need to do some            preprocessing over the tree, something like storing sum of all its predecessor nodes.	 For finding kth smallest element, use order statistics approach:
 https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-k-th-smallest-element-in-bst-order-statistics-in-bst/
3)  Given a sorted array which has been rotated n number of times. Find the value of n.
	 It is similar to below post where you need to find only the pivot element. If you have the  Index of pivot element, you can get the number of times the array is rotated.
	 https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/search-an-element-in-a-sorted-and-pivoted-array/
Round 3:
1) Count ways to reach nth stair.
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/count-ways-reach-nth-stair/
	It is similar to fibonacci series. Interviewer asked various ways to implement the same –            Recursion, 1-D array, with 3 variables and complexity of each.
2)   Design recommendation engine.
	It’s like auto suggestion. I gave the trie approach. The interviewer seemed fine with         this approach and asked me to write full code with time and space complexities.	Implementation of Tries:
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/trie-insert-and-search/
Round 4 (Managerial Round – Over video call)
Tell me about yourself.
Current work
Which project you liked working the most.
Any case where you had conflict with your manager.
Any idea/technology suggested by you to your team which then got implemented and worked out.
Any case when you had to work out of your comfort zone.
The most critical feedback received from your manager/team members.
What do you do to enhance your technical knowledge apart from your project work.
    And many more.

Round 5(Final Round – Telephonic)
Initially I was asked questions about the work I had done, the projects I did and some managerial questions.
Then I was given a coding problem to solve. They use Collabedit tool in phone screen interviews where the same screen is shared by both interviewer and interviewee.
	Ques : Print all the non-repeating words out of two given sentences.
	Eg. Statement 1:   I have a blue pen.
	      Statement 2:   I got a red pen.
	      Output : have blue got red
	Discussion : I suggested the hashing approach. The interviewer asked to implement the same.

Points to take care:
You must know how to calculate time and space complexities.
In each round they ask you about the project you recently did/ the project you liked working most/ most challenging work etc –  so you should be prepared well for at least one project with in-depth details.
Start with the naive approach for each question asked and then proceed with solutions with better space and time complexities.
No need to waste time reading about Operating Systems, Networking, DBMS etc. They only care about the projects you did and your coding skills whether you cover all the edge cases while writing code, know time and space complexities, have better approaches for solving same problem and so on.



Round 1:
Discussion : I gave two approaches one with DFS and other with level order traversal.
He asked to compare two approaches and implement the efficient one. DFS is the efficient one because in level order, you need to store all the nodes at each level, some of them may not be a part of the left view of BT.
Round 2:
Round 3:
It is similar to fibonacci series. Interviewer asked various ways to implement the same -Recursion, 1-D array, with 3 variables and complexity of each.
Round 4(Managerial Round – Over video call)
Round 5(Final Round – Telephonic)
Points to take care:



I got a call from an consultant for recruitment drive in Delhi.
First round (1 hour 30 minutes): online writtenIt was online written round on a platform called Stockroom.io.
Expected time complexity is O(n). The only thing to pay attention was that ASCII characters starts from A.

Second round(1 hour): Design round  This was most critical and important round.
First HLD was required, use cases, flow diagram. then a low level design was required all necessary classes where will u use polymorphism, where inheritance, multithreading, synchronised approach if needed, socket connections. Other things that surfaced and he asked as interview goes : round robin load balancer, hash-map based load balancer, two layer caching, nosql db, design patterns, solid principles, ACID property, CAP theorem etc. Interviewer was a senior person and knew a lot. I was nervous in this round but answered well.
Third round (1 hour): technical
Fourth round (1 hour): technical He asked me what you like , I said array questions 🙂 He started laughing.
      he asked me to write code for the same. made some variations like lazy propagation.
Hr came and told me that we are done for the day one more interview is there which was on next day.
Hr was very supportive she gave me some constructive feedback and told me to get prepared well and come next day as next day was
with a Bar Raiser.
Fifth round (1 hour): technical+ design + behavioural, Bar Raiser
Few things to remember:



1st
2nd
3rd
No actual coding
4th
Bar raiser:
Hiring manager 1
Hiring manager 2 



Requirement was that the candidates should have strong troubleshooting skills, strong knowledge of scripting in any language + Strong coding skills and problem solving skills.

Expected Output : 123456789X
[2 Marks]

Round 2 : Technical/Problem Solving F2F Interview
Then the interviewer asked me whether my code for the run length encoding asked in the written round will run for all the inputs. I was pretty sure that it would run. He gave me a case where my code was failing. He told me to modify my code. Also, I had used Hashing technique for this problem so he asked few questions on HashMap how it works.

Round 2: Debugging and Troubleshooting/Scripting
She modified the question and asked me if 3-4 customers complains the same that they are not able to login to their Amazon account, how will you troubleshoot the issue.
Debugging – How will you debug the issue whatever you have troubleshooted.

Round 4: Troubleshooting/Debugging/Problem Solving/ Managerial
At last, HR called me and told that I am rejected. 🙁



I applied off campus for Amazon Bangalore SDE-1. It started with two face to face rounds.
Face-2-Face (Round 1) :
Face-2-Face (Round 2):
He started introducing himself and then asked me some behavioural questions.
And then he asked me one dynamic programming question.
A matrix is given and each cell has some value. You can enter from any cell of first row and make three different moves down, south-east and south-west i.e. from (i,j) to (i+1,j+1), (i+1,j-1),(i+1,j). You need to calculate maximum value when you reach last row.
I gave recursive solution of complexity O(3^n) and then finally gave him dynamic programming solution in O(n^2). He was not done yet then he asked me to print the path as well. I did.
Both interviews were good so I was waiting for results. After 2 days I got the call you have cleared both the rounds and they want to conduct two more rounds. Next step was two more face-2-face rounds.
 Face-2-Face (Round 3):
It was a bar raiser round very crucial for the whole process. Interviewer introduced himself and asked me behavioural questions like:
I was currently working on Blockchain so he asked me about this technology cause its totally new and amazing tech so he was pretty impressed. He asked if I have any question for him. I asked several question related to his work and Amazon visions.

Face-2-Face (Round 4): Hiring manager round
This round was behavioural round and cultural fit. He asked so many questions related to projects and current work.
Then he asked me explain current company project and project architecture, my role in team etc. Guys prepare well for behavioural questions, they look for culture fit.
Coding question:
Print the vertical sum of a binary tree.
Result : I got the call after 3 days and hr said congratulations, you are placed and It was like dream came true.
Thanks to my parents, Upendra Bhaiya and Prajakta for all the support. I want to thank geeksforgeeks team, it’s an ideal platform for preparing coding interviews.



A big big thanks to geeks for geeks for constructing this platform where candidates find suitable question sets. 
1. 1st Round (Coding round on hacker rank) :
    Two questions. Each of 100 marks. Total time given was 2 hours.
    Question 1: Unit Area of largest region of 1’s 
    Question 2: Largest Sum Contiguous Subarray
2. 2nd Round (Tech) : 
    Two questions. Here the basic knowledge of data structures and algorithm is tested to determine whether candidate is eligible for onsite interview rounds or not.
    Question 1: Find zeroes to be flipped so that number of consecutive 1’s is maximized
    Question 2: A program to check if a binary tree is BST or not
3. 3rd Round (Tech):
    Two questions. Knowledge of algorithms and data structure was tested. Along with it, production level code had to be written on paper and it was to be made sure that no edge cases remain uncovered.
    Question 1: Print nodes at k distance from root
    Question 2: Print all nodes at distance k from a given node
4. 4th Round (Tech):
    Same checks as present in 3rd round. Since i did not perform well in the 2nd question of 3rd round, more stress on my coding part was given in this round. They were thoroughly checking my code and pointing all the edge cases if any.
    Question 1: Clone a linked list with next and random pointer 
    Question 2: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6179635/what-is-a-good-data-structure-for-storing-and-searching-2d-spatial-coordinates-i
5. 5th Round (Hiring Manager – Tech & Non Tech):
    Checks were same as above rounds. Along with those, whether the candidate was a good fit at amazon was checked. 
    Question 1: Given a stream of integers, at any point of time, fetch the count of integers which are smaller than a given number.  
    Question 2: HR Questions
     – give an instance where your manager and you disagreed.
     – give an instance where you outperformed yourself.
     – expiain your project and your role in it.
     – explain the most difficult project you’ve faced.
6. 6th Round (Bar raiser Tech and Non Tech) : 
     This guy will thoroughly check everything starting from code, algorithm, data structure, behavior etc. It is necessary of every candidate to crack this round. 
    Question 1:
    Given the below pattern, write a recursive code for all values of n. 
    Question 2:

Bar Raiser Round:



I went through some interview rounds for SDE-2 in amazon. Below is the format.
Round1:
Round2:
Round3:
Round4:



I went for face to face interview and faced following questions.



I recently got an interview call from Amazon (Chennai) for the Kindle team. Here is my experience:-
Round 1 – It was written round (Pen & Paper) consisting of three questions –
1. Run length encoding of a string.  Ex – Input – aaaabbcd  , Output – a4b2c1d1
2. Given a linked list consisting of characters. Determine if it is a palindrome or not?  O (1) space complexity.
3. Connect nodes at same level.  Check if Linked List is Palindrome
Out of 30 people, they shortlisted 6 of them for further rounds. I was one of them.
Round 2 (F2F) – It was purely based on programming standards:
1. Given a binary tree with two nodes, find the lowest common ancestor of them.
2. Adding to first ques, he further asked; find the minimum distance between any two nodes.
3. There is a conference room. N people are joining the conference. You have the start time and end time of each of them visiting it. You are asked to determine the maximum number of people that can be inside the room. 
Answer will be – 3
It went well. I was able to answer all of them. They asked me write production level code for each of them. Take care of all the end cases. Three out of six were able to make it.
Round 3 (F2F) – This round was grilling and was again on programming standards:
1. Print the top view of binary tree.
2. Find the maximum sum of any rectangle in a square matrix of n x n.
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming-set-27-max-sum-rectangle-in-a-2d-matrix/.
They provide you necessary hints whenever needed or if they feel you are not able to find a solution or thinking in a very wrong direction.
After this, they call me to Chennai for further two rounds of process.

Round 4 (Hiring Manager) – In this round, they focused on my experience and previous company’s work.
       All behavioral type of questions like:
1. How do you measure your success in the whole year?
2. Mention some of the negative and positive feedbacks from you manager.
3. Why you want to leave the firm so early? Why Amazon.
4. Questions on my projects and achievements in current company.
Hints: Just do not blame you current company as answer to any question. A clever way to deal this round is make them realize you are quite good for amazon.
P.S. Some research on Amazon before the interview would be great. 
Round 5 (Bar Raiser) – This was my final round. It was mixture of behavioral and coding.
Behavioral question were almost same what I mentioned above.
Discussions on my Final year project and what new I can add to it if I am given a chance to improvise it.
Some coding questions:
1. Given two strings, find the uncommon characters in them using single hash map.
2. Given data of millions of people, (name, age, M/F etc.) Develop an API that will have age range as input and yield the count of people under this range as output.
Thanks Geeksforgeeks for all the references. You people are doing great!
Key points:
1. Just write clean and crisp code, whenever asked to code considering the end cases.
2. Maintain continuous discussions with interviewer. He/She will help you whenever needed.



I went through some interview rounds for SDE-2 in amazon. Below is the format.
Round1: It was a test on HackerEarth with two programming questions
Round 2:
Write production ready code. Consider scenario for duplicates too.

Round 3:



Attended two interview rounds for SDE II position. Rejected after second round.
Round 1 : Q1 – Design spelling checker web service.
Round 2 : Q1 – Design cricket scoreboard.


Some time back I went through an interview for Amazon.com for SDE-1 role, and here is my experience to help other aspirants :
Written – Pen & Paper Rounds
Had to write production level code in any programming language of my choice, covering all the edge cases, and clearly mentioning the complexity of my code.
Solution: GeeksforGeeks Link
Solved it using Binary search tree

Face to Face Rounds?
Interviewers were very very helpful, and were focused on approach, they will ask basic brute force solution first, then an optimum solution, after that they may increase the complexity of problem a little bit, and if you are able to explain your approach satisfactorily, then will ask you to write production level code in any programming language of your choice, covering all edge cases using pen and paper : 
Advice to fellow members preparing for something like Amazon : 
I hope this information will be helpful to all of you, wish you all the very very best.

Round 1 (45 Mins)
Brief description of the current project: Architecture, Technologies, Workflow etc.
Round 2 (50 Mins)
Solution: GeeksforGeeks Link
He asked questions like most challenging task you did in your past experience, I explained him about middlewares I implemented earlier for tracking the exceptions in code.

Round 3 (written)
    I was called in Amazon office after few days (very nice office)
I believe this round was just for warmup.
Round 4 (45 Mins)
Brief description of current project: this time he was more focused on technologies and tools. He asked every technology I mentioned in deep.
Queries would be like: GET name, so output would be Pratik. (something like that)

I applied through recruiter, i was having 4 year exp while appearing for this interview, overall it was quite lengthy process.
I shared my resume to recruiter and later was scheduled a telephonic discussion
Telephonic Round 1:
Brief Intro from both the side then he asked the technical question,
Then there was gap of almost 3 weeks with no clue on feedback then suddenly recruiter contacted me stating the positive feedback from telephonic discussion and invite for In House interview at Amazon Gurgaon office since i was in NCR region.
Round 2:
This was completely technical round, i was asked to three technical question, not much tough
Round 3:
This was kind of mix of technical and some behavioral questions
Initially interview asked some of the questions from resume then jumped to the technical questions,
Round 4:
This round was completely design round (LLD and HLD)
Design Debugger then in between he moved to design Meeting scheduler
In last 10 minute he asked me to give HLD of Clock Room
Round 5:
This was taken by some senior developer,
He asked few question related to previous work, its challenges then moved to technical question
Then again some behavioral question,
This type of questions.
These all rounds happen on the same day, then i was asked to leave for the day and wait till next week for getting the feedback and next steps if any.
After 1 week, i got mail stating that, we would like to proceed further and scheduled my bar raiser round.
Round 6 (BR):
It was telephonic discussion,
Interviewer judged me on Amazon leadership principles,
And i believe i just slips on one of the principle but overall he was satisfied with my responses.
And he asked me to explain HLD for Automatic Parking System.
This interview stretched for long since there was some network connectivity issue with my cell network,
In last he asked me to explain just the approach of solving a technical problem,
Exact question i don’t remember but it was related to merging k sorted array.
Round 7 (HM):
Nearly next week this interview was scheduled since Hiring mangers were not available due to their busy schedule,
Majority of the time this interview was around behavioral questions and Amazon leadership principles.
In last he asked me to design Game Studio like amoeba game zone.
                                         




Round 1: Telephonic round.
Round 2:
On site Interview:
Round 3:
Round 3:
 


Round 0: Online Coding Test (90 Min – 4 Coding Questions)
GeeksforGeeks Link

After 1 month recruiter called for f2f rounds. There were 4 rounds on the same day.
Round 1: Hiring Manager Round (Behaviour + Design)(1.5 Hrs)
Intro, Project & Lot of Behaviour Questions
Lot of other behaviour questions. Finally gave a design problem to solve.
Design:
Do integration for Splitwise app with Amazon Pay (or Paytm)
1) where a person can pay to another person and money directly gets deposited into other person’s bank account.
2) A person can also send reminder to another person for owning money.
Round 2: Design Round (1.5 Hrs)
Round 3: Coding Round (1.5 Hrs)
GeeksforGeeks Link

Round 4: Coding Round (1.5 Hrs)
First write the data structure to solve this problem, then efficient algorithm, then complete working code on paper.

 
Overall it was a positive experience, recruiter kept me informed about the progress and about next rounds. First four rounds went well but I wasn’t able to solve 5th round problem, and was eliminated after then.
Thanks a lot to geeks for geeks for having such a great amount of collection to practice on.
 
Advise:
 


It was a recruitment drive at Pune, for Kindle team (Chennai).
Round 1 (Screening):
Two common questions were given to all. We’re supposed to discuss the approach to the problem with the interviewer first and then implement it after the interviewer is convinced with your approach.
Round 2 (Problem Solving):
Round 3 (Problem Solving):
Round 4 (Design):
Round 5 (Bar raiser):
Few questions to evaluate me on Amazon’s leadership principles.  I can’t remember them all 🙁
And one algorithmic problem at the end. Diameter of a binary tree
Round 6 (Hiring manager):
Note:  In problem solving rounds, you’re supposed to write a working code in any language of your choice, handling all the corner cases.
Finally got an offer after 3 days!! 🙂 All the best!! (y)

I was interviewed for customer returns team for Hyderabad campus. I had 1 year and 9 month experience at the time of getting interviewed. Less experience was something which was worrying me a lot. They generally ask for 3-5 years of experience, but come down to 2 years if you are good.
1. What is so special about typescript that both Angular and React included it in the recent versions. Tsc compiler, final output, difference between java, JS and TS were discussed. Any live project use case where TS helped more than JS (I come from a pure JS background that’s why this question was asked)
2. Design a vending machine with following functionalities
Both HLD and LLD were expected.
Round 2 to 6 were done in Amazon Hyderabad campus. All interviews were back to back. It started from 11 AM to 5:30 PM with just half an hour lunch break. Before I could even step out after completing one round, other interviewers would already be waiting outside. Interviewers were very helping, but only if your are thinking in the right direction. HR also was very supportive. He was coming and motivating me after every round. Some advices here
 


Round 1: Telephonic Round 
 
Round 2: Face to Face interview 
Round 3: Face to Face interview 
It was not a coding question only. He expected me to write a Heap interface and using that implement min heap or max heap. And also write the heapify code


Round 1:
Round 2:
Round 3:
Design round:
Round 4: 
Managerial round, lot of project and Amazon’s leadership principle related questions.
Round 5:
Bar Raiser: Lot of behavioral and leadership principle questions, then asked a design question, design a load balancer’s algorithm so that it redirects the traffic between three services s1, s2, s3 by 50%, 30% and 20%. further clause added to handle various clients calling to specific services.
 
Tips for the interview:  Good hands on towards problem solving and algorithm, HLD and LLD,   prepare well for Amazon’s leadership principles.

This interview was for the SDE-2 position for logistic management department of amazon. I had applied for this job on naukari.com.
Round 1:

There was an online codding test on Hackerearth. Two questions were asked. I don’t remember them now.
Round 2:
After two weeks they scheduled a telephonic round.
Question 1: Given a matrix of ‘0’ and ‘1’, find the largest Iceland (i.e area of  ‘1’s)
Question 2. Design a data structure with constant time for insert, delete, search and getRandom.
I had given solutions for the both.
Round 3 :
This was onsite interview at Hyderabad.
First he asked about my past projects and challenges faced. He then asked if I had designed anything on top of current a system.
Next a technical question was given;
Given an array of integers  and a window size ‘k’, find first negative number for each possible window in the array.
I first gave him a two queue approach(was not optimal), he told to code it on paper. After I wrote the code, he asked to optimize it further. Finally after few iterations, I gave him an optimal two pointer approach.
My suggestion here is; do not hurry to present your solution to interviewer,   first try to come-up with best optimal solution. For SDE-2 positions they expect optimal solution at the very first place from you.
Round 4 :
This was all project and HLD related round.
There were two interviewers. The first introduced themselves and told about what their group does at amazon.
He then asked about my role at previous company and past projects I did in brief. Then asked if I have done something like adding new functionality or suggested some improvement for the project that was not asked by customer or manager.
He then asked me to draw HLD for meeting calendar system. Then there was discussion on various issues on it like scalability, what database should be used; SQL-NoSQL, concurrency etc.
 
All the best guys!


Amazon visited our campus(DAIICT) to recruit interns and FTEs. I’m sharing my internship interview experience.
There were 2 rounds in all – 1 Online Round followed by 1 F2F Interview.
Online Round(90 min ):
There were 24 questions based on Logical Reasoning, 7 questions based on Debugging and 2 questions of coding.
The 2 coding questions were:
Out of around 250 students, 53 were shortlisted for Round 2.
->Doing MCQ (Logical Reasoning) was important. Few students who solved both the coding question but didn’t attempt the MCQs were not selected while some who could solve 80% of 1 question(8/10 test cases) and few MCQs were selected.
Round 2: FTF Interview (Around 90 mins):
The interviewer asked me some HR questions like Why Amazon? , Introduce myself 
Reverse every k node. 
Then he asked me a question on the graph. I told him that I have not prepared for it, but I had a course called design and analysis in my semester 3 so I will try to recall that and try to answer your question. 1) given n cities and every city is connected via m roads. There is no cycle in the graph. Each road between city x and city y has some traffic denoted by weight of the edge. Each city has one stadium. Now suppose in one city, a cricket match is conducted and all other cities’ people come to that city to watch a match. Total traffic denoted by the sum of edges of all city. The task is to find maximum traffic coming to that city at any point in time.

Suppose the match is in the city coloured with black. So traffic coming to that is from 3 sides.  one from the group of three cities and traffic will be (9+5+4+2 = 20), second will be from (15 + 6= 21) and third will be(1+4=5). so ans will be max of these and thus ans = 21.
When he gave me this question I don’t know the answer but I tried a lot. I gave him around 3 approaches and discussed with the interviewer but he said that my approach is wrong. But then I tried and never give up. Then he gave me the hint to do bfs and then dfs from neighbouring. I got a hint and answered the question and wrote code. Then, he asked me if I had any questions for him.
Out of the 53 selected for the interviews, 13 were finally selected for the internship.
Verdict: Selected.
Tips :
During my preparation geeks for geeks, indeed, was a great help. Almost all the questions asked in the interview were from geeks. A big thank you to other geeks as well for sharing their interview experiences as going through past experiences was the perfect way to end my preparations.


Hi, I was recently interviewed for SDE1 position for Amazon and got selected. I have 1.5 year experience in java. Geeksforgeeks helped me lot. I am very thankful to Geeksforgeeks team. Following were interview questions-
Two telephonic rounds followed by 5 F2F interviews.
Round 1 (Telephonic):
1. There is a dictionary already implemented. Write a method, which takes input String without space, to prints all subsets of the input string which is present in dictionary.
Example: Dictionary – a*
………….Input- aaabaa
………….Output- a,a,a,aa,aa,aaa,a,a,aa
2. There is a dictionary already implemented. Write a method , which takes input String without space, to replace the characters from the strings which are not present in dictionary with –
Example: Dictionary – a*
………….Input- aaabaa
………….Output- aaa_aa
Interviewer was cool. Did not code properly (lots of bugs were in code), but gave good approach for first question. For second question solution sent in a mail.
Round 2 (Telephonic):
1. Write a program to remove duplicates from array of prime numbers.
2. Write a program to return nearest elements from a binary search tree for input element.
This round was very good. Interviewer was very happy with my approach for both questions. Code did not have big bug.
Round 1 (F2F- Problem Solving and coding):
1. Tell me about yourself.
2. Write a program to find top 10 elements on an array of integers.
Don’t remember much. Questions were easy. This round was very good. Interviewer was happy with solution.

Written Round
1. Given an array in which elements are first increasing and then decreasing. find the maximum element in the array.
2. Given an array of unsorted elements, find the minimum difference between any 2 elements in the array.
1st f2f
Discussion about my projects (nearly 20 mins)
1. Given an array of positive numbers, find the maximum sum of a subsequence with the constraint that no 2 numbers in the sequence should be adjacent in the array. (extended to negative numbers)
2.Write a function to print the level order traversal of a binary tree in spiral form.
2nd f2f
Small discussion about my projects
1.Write a function to find the next smallest palindrome number of the given number. for example: if given number is 12345, then the next smallest palindrome is 12421.
2.Given 2 strings str1 and str2. What is the efficient way to navigate from str1 to str2? The constraints are i) a string can be changed to another string by changing only one character. ii) all the intermediate strings must be present in dictionary. If not possible, return “not possible to navigate from str1 to str2”. (pre-processing is allowed and enough memory is available). for example: str1 = feel and str2 = pelt, then the navigation is feel -> fell -> felt -> pelt (Hint: Graph)
3rd f2f
Discussion about my projects (nearly 20 mins)
1. Given two numbers represented by two linked lists, write a function that returns sum list. The sum list is linked list representation of addition of two input numbers. It is not allowed to modify the lists. Also, not allowed to use explicit extra space.
2. Given a matrix of characters and a string, find whether the string can be obtained from the matrix. From each character in the matrix, we can move up/down/right/left. for example, if the matrix[3][4] is

Time and space complexity must for all questions
Start from brute force and go to optimized solution.
All edge cases are to be covered in code?
Think out loud all the time (so that even when questions are easy they will catch your thinking with greater importance)

level). ( cousins )
b) Now write a recursive solution of the same.
I took a long time in coming up with the recursive solution for this question, but eventually solved it.
For each question I was asked write production level code.



Interview 1: 
Before the interview began we were asked to solve 6 questions
In the first interview i was asked how i solved Q4) replace all spaces with ‘%20’ and Q6) nth node from the end of a linked list.
and then we discussed in details about a project I did with my previous employer.
and then He asked a few questions ->
Q1) Dynamic Programming | Set 21 (Variations of LIS) – GeeksforGeeks -> 1. Building Bridges: Consider a 2-D map with a horizontal river passing through its center. There are n cities on the southern bank with x-coordinates a(1) … a(n) and n cities on the northern bank with x-coordinates b(1) … b(n). You want to connect as many north-south pairs of cities as possible with bridges such that no two bridges cross. When connecting cities, you can only connect city i on the northern bank to city i on the southern bank.
Q2) Write a C program to print all permutations of a given string – GeeksforGeeks -> Print all permutations of a string
Q3) Given the arrival and departure time of various trains in a station. Calculate the minimum number of platforms required such that no train has to wait for another train to vacate the platform.
The question basically means calculate the maximum number of trains that would be present in the platform at any given time.
Answer
sort the arrival time and sort the departure time, keep a count initialized to 0. compare the first element of the arrival time with the first of departure, increase the value of count if the value at current Index at arrival is less than the value index at departure and increment the arrival index, and vice versa. Keep the maximum count that you see.

Round 2
Q1) given the x,y,z coordinates of a billion stars (basically the entire array can’t fit in the RAM) calculate the k closest.
Answer -> use a max heap that contains the k minimum distances.
Time-> n(log k)
then the question was changed to -> now that we have several computers which can combine to fit the entire set of stars, how will you then solve it?
Answer-> use selection algo (similar to step 1 of quick sort) to find the k closest stars in each of the computers. Time -> O(n) and then use the k in the those m computers to find the minimum k. One way is to sort all them individually. and then create a min heap to calculate k minimum.
O(k^2 log k)
Q2)  Symmetric Tree (Mirror Image of itself) – GeeksforGeeks -> How to check if the tree is the mirror of itself
Then the question was extended to a n-ary tree.
Answer -> Please read the above link before reading this answer– We create a the n ary tree like this->
then we have the number of children of each node as nodeName->child.size();
we use it to compare the first child of the node with the last child, 2nd with 2nd last and so on:

Round 3
Q1) Write a C code to evaluate an expression tree.
Answer-> It has to be done in a post order traversal method, since the value of the left subtree is independent of the right subtree.
Q2) Articulation Points (or Cut Vertices) in a Graph – GeeksforGeeks -> Check for Articulation points
Q3) Given a stream of number, like 1,3,5,4,6,9 print 1,3-6,9
Answer-> create a hash map that contains the value of the ending index of the previous sequence.
key is the number and the value is the index where it occurs.
when we get 4, we have to check for the index of 3 and 5. (One above and one below)
the value at 3 is 1 and 4’s index is 3, so they can’t be paired.
We then check for 5. 5’s index is 2 and 4’s is 3, since they are together, they can be paired.
and then we check for 3 again, 3’s index is 1 and 4’s index is 2-3, so they can match
We go on. I don’t think I answered the questions the way it was asked, but he seemed ok with the answer I gave.
Next he modified more to include distributed systems in it. And asked me if there were several systems which received the input in round robin manner, how would I implement the above algorithms. I had no idea about this.
After round 3, I was called by Amazon and told that my first two rounds were positive but round 3 wasn’t. Round 3 was the hiring manager round, and he wasn’t happy that I had little idea about RAID ( Standard RAID levels – Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia )
So I had another hiring manager round.
Round 4
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-a-pair-with-given-sum-in-bst/
Find a pair with a given sum in a bst
more questions on what happened in Round 3 and why I want to leave my current firm.
Round 5 (Bar Raiser)
Questions like
1) tell me a time when you had a different opinion than the rest of the team.
2) tell me a time when you were thinking that the problem is something else, but it turned out to be something else
3) tell me a time when your opinion were discarded.
4) tell me a time when you had to work on a very short notice.
Coding questions-
1) given that we can form packs of 6,9 and 20 pens. Given a number x, calculate if we can form combinations of packs to form those many pens. Eg 24 pens can be formed by having 2 packs of 9 pens and 1 of 6 and 23 pens can’t be formed.
Answer
Dynamic Programming with the recursive function
DP[i]=DP[i-6]||DP[i-9]||DP[i-20];
2) Design an escalator system. Which classes would you make, etc.
After Round 5, they didn’t find me a cultural fit so they conducted a Round 6.
Round 6
Questions like- tell me something about yourself,
a time when you helped someone
A time when you shared a different opinion from your manager.

Round 1:
Q-1 Given an array os 0s and 1s, and another input m, I was supposed to tell the longest continuous streak of 1s after flipping m 0s to 1s. E.g., Array is {1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1} m = 1 (which means I can flip ‘m’ one 0 to 1)
Answer: 6 (if we flip 0 at index 7, we get the longest continuous streak of 1s having length 6)
Q-2 Given N ropes of lengths L1, L2, L3, L4, …, LN. I had to join every rope to get a final rope of length L1 + L2 + … + LN.
However, I can join only two ropes at a time and the cost of joining the two ropes is L1 + L2. I was supposed to join ropes in such a way that the cost is minimum.
Round 2:
Q-3 Given a BST, I needed to serialize it and deserialize it. This essentially boiled down to generating the “traversal” string and getting the BST back from the traversal.
Q-4 There are two linked lists. Both linked lists have a single-digit number in their nodes. I needed to
treat this linked lists as a numbers and add them up and store the digits in a new linked list.
E.g., head -> 5 -> 6 -> 7-> 9
head -> 2-> 1 -> 1
Resultant linked list: head-> 5 -> 8-> 9-> 0 (5679 + 211 = 5890)
Round 3: Hiring Manager round
Q-5 Project discussion in detail. Most challenging problem, how did you solve it, had any disagreement with manager, how did you fix it etc.
Q-6 Given an array {2, 4, 6, 0, 1, 8, 1}, where each element represents the height of tower located at its index. I was supposed to tell how much maximum water can accumulate in this “valley” once it rains.
Round 4:
Q-7 Given the encoding rule:
A -> 0
B -> 1
C -> 2
…
K -> 10
…
Z -> 25
I was supposed to get the number of original strings possible given an encoded input.
E.g., Given input 10, two possible original strings are possible BA and K, the answer is 2.
Q-8 Given two trees, find out if the second tree is a “subtree” of the first one.
Answer: No (Tree 2 is not a subtree of Tree A)
Round 5: Engineering manager round
Q-8 Engineering Manager round, all behavioral, why do you want to leave the company, one challenging problem, how did you overcome it, your biggest failure etc. etc.



I recently had interviews with Amazon at Hyderabad for SDE 1. I had around 1 year and 9 months of experience.
Telephonic Interview :
It started with a brief introduction of mine and my work. Then he asked me a coding question
1) Given a linked list eg : 1->2->3->4->5->6, make the following changes    1->6->2->5->3->4
Easy but it was lengthy. Had to write production level code.
After 2-3 hours, I got an invitation for in house interview at Amazon campus:
Round 1 : Face 2 Face
It started with a discussion about my previous work and projects. After the discussion he asked the following technical questions:
1) Given a pre-order traversal, construct a binary search tree.
Simple solution. Asked me to code it.
2) Given an alien dictionary, find the order of the alphabets in the dictionary.
Only the approach was required. I explained him the approach and he was satisfied.
3) Connect n ropes with minimum cost
I was asked to write production level code for the above problem.
Round 2 : Face to Face
Again the interview started with a discussion about my projects and then he asked a technical question.
1) Given m sorted arrays with n elements, merge these arrays into one sorted array of size m*n
I did hear about this question before but never really saw the optimized solution so I gave a O(m*m*n) solution. He asked me to optimize it, but I wasn’t able to do so, hence he asked me to code the O(m*m*n) solution. I took a lot of time to code it as I wanted to handle all the edge cases. Finally I coded it. He didn’t find any issues but he asked me to make it better. And then I suggested using heaps to get the minimum of all the m arrays.
Lot of questions on why heap and why not BST. Asked me to prove it mathematically.
But he was satisfied once I gave the solution using heaps.
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-k-sorted-arrays/
Round 3 Bar Raiser : Telephonic
Discussion on my previous projects and asked some behavioral questions like why are you leaving your current company, conflicts with your manager etc
Technical questions:
1) Find the maximum element in an array which is first increasing and then decreasing
2) Find the Pythagoras triplet in an array
Gave an O(n3) solution then made it O(n2logn). He asked me to optimise it even further.
Finally came up with O(n2) solution
3) Given a very large binary number which cannot be stored in a variable, determine the remainder of the decimal equivalent of the binary number when divided by 3
I had no clue about this question. He gave me a hint, with which I was able to solve it. But later, he asked me to find the remainder for any number k. Again he gave a hint and I was able to solve it.
Basically when we append a digit to a binary number, the previous binary number gets doubled, hence the remainder also gets doubled. 
By keeping track of the remainder of the previous binary number, the current remainder can be determined.
Round 4 Hiring Manager: Face to Face
Behavioral questions along with some questions about my previous projects.
Then he gave me a technical question:
1) Given a number say ‘1234’, return the number in words i.e One thousand two hundred and thirty four
Was able to cover all the scenarios. He was satisfied with my approach
Suggestions:
Think loud and be confident. It’s okay if you don’t know the answer at first. They mostly see how you solve questions for which you don’t know the solution.
Thanks geeksforgeeks. You guys are doing an awesome job.



Round 1: It was a written round with three question.
Q1) Find a peak element. 
Q2) Top View of binary tree. 
Q3) Maximum difference between node and its ancestor in Binary Tree. 
Round 2 (F2F):
Q1) Given an array of distinct integers, find if there are two pairs (a, b) and (c, d) such that a+b = c+d, and a, b, c and d are distinct elements. If there are multiple answers, then print any of them. Expected complexity :  O(n2
Q2) Lowest Common Ancestor in a Binary Tree
In both the questions, they needed a proper working code covering every edge cases.
Round 3 (F2F):
Q1) If I am designing a media player and I want to store songs and play them in random order
a) What data structure will you use to store songs?
b) How will you select the next song to play in a way which prevents the same song being played in consecutive turn.
I spend some time and finally came up with the working solution.
Q2) Clone a binary tree with random pointers. 
(Hint: Use HashMap)
 
Round 4 (Telephonic) :
Q1) Tell me about yourself. Your current company, your role and responsibilities. Reason for leaving current company.
Q2) Maximum triangle path Sum : Starting from the top of a pyramid of numbers like below, you can walk down going one step on the right or on the left, until you reach the bottom row:

One of such walks is 55 -> 94 >- 30 -> 26. You can compute the total of the numbers you have seen in such walk, in this case it’s 205.
Your problem is to find the maximum total among all possible paths from the top to the bottom row of the triangle. In the little example above it’s 321.
Q3) Design your own Process Control Block(PCB).
Q4) Give me an example of a project that didn’t work out well?
Q5) What are some of the things that you and your supervisor have disagreed about?
Round 5 (Telephonic) :

It started with a discussion about my previous work and projects. After the discussion he asked the following technical questions:
1) Given a pre-order traversal, construct a binary search tree.
Simple solution. Asked me to code it.
2) Given an alien dictionary, find the order of the alphabets in the dictionary.
Only the approach was required. I explained him the approach and he was satisfied. Here is the link to the code anyway:
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/given-sorted-dictionary-find-precedence-characters/
3) Connect n ropes with minimum cost
I was asked to write production level code for the above problem.
Round 2 : Face to Face
Again the interview started with a discussion about my projects and then he asked a technical question.
1) Given m sorted arrays with n elements, merge these arrays into one sorted array of size m*n
I did hear about this question before but never really saw the optimized solution so I gave a O(m*m*n) solution. He asked me to optimize it, but I wasn’t able to do so, hence he asked me to code the O(m*m*n) solution. I took a lot of time to code it as I wanted to handle all the edge cases. Finally I coded it. He didn’t find any issues but he asked me to make it better. And then I suggested using heaps to get the minimum of all the m arrays.
Lot of questions on why heap and why not BST. Asked me to prove it mathematically.
But he was satisfied once I gave the solution using heaps.
Round 3 Bar Raiser : Telephonic
Discussion on my previous projects and asked some behavioral questions like why are you leaving your current company, conflicts with your manager etc
Technical questions:
1) Find the maximum element in an array which is first increasing and then decreasing 
2) Find the Pythagoras triplet in an array
Gave an O(n3) solution then made it O(n2logn). He asked me to optimize it even further.
Finally came up with O(n2) solution.
3) Given a very large binary number which cannot be stored in a variable, determine the remainder of the decimal equivalent of the binary number when divided by 3
I had no clue about this question. He gave me a hint, with which I was able to solve it. But later, he asked me to find the remainder for any number k. Again he gave a hint and I was able to solve it.
Basically when we append a digit to a binary number, the previous binary number gets doubled, hence the remainder also gets doubled. 
By keeping track of the remainder of the previous binary number, the current remainder can be determined.
Round 4 Hiring Manager: Face to Face
Behavioral questions along with some questions about my previous projects.
Then he gave me a technical question:
1) Given a number say ‘1234’, return the number in words i.e One thousand two hundred and thirty four
Was able to cover all the scenarios. He was satisfied with my approach
Suggestions:
Think loud and be confident. It’s okay if you don’t know the answer at first. They mostly see how you solve questions for which you don’t know the solution.
Thanks geeksforgeeks. You guys are doing an awesome job.



1.       Given infinite sequence of number, how you will store it in a system. Find whether the given  sequence is palindrome or not. 
Ans: He suggested to store all the number in a linked list and then find Palindrome or not
2.       A) Find the path with given sum in a Binary tree from the root
B) Find the path with given sum in a Binary tree from any node in the tree.
3.       Print all possible balanced parenthesis.
4.       Implementation of publisher and subscriber design pattern.
5.       Find the given sum in unsorted array.



I am 1.5 year experienced guy, currently working in one good Product Based company in Whitefield,Bangalore. I have spent 1.2 years in my present company and previously, I spent 6 months in TCS Pune.
Recently, I got a chance to be interviewed by Amazon at Bangalore, through a referral (made friend from Facebook :p). I was preparing for Amazon from last 6-8 months from GeeksforGeeks.org. I must say, GeeksforGeeks is making life of people. I got an offer from Amazon by preparing from GeeksForGeeks.
Questions :
As I reached to 25th Floor of WTC, Brigade Gateway, we 25 people were asked to write code for these 3 questions on paper (OnSite Written Round) :
1. Two numbers are represented by 2 linkedlists. Find the resultant linkedlist represented as sum of these given linkedlists.
2. Given a number say 12345, find the immediate next number using the same digits, in this case 12354.
3. 3 points of a triangle are given. Find if given forth point lies inside or outside of the triangle.
F2F Round 1 :
1. Given a Hotel and checkin/Checkout time of visitors, find the maximum numbers of rooms required. (different version of Trains/Platform question)
2. Given sequentially placed boxes, each representing a number( which may be positive or negative), we need to select the numbers in order to have the maximum sum, having the constraint that if we seelct a given box, we cannot select adjacent box to it, but can select any other.
Solution : let the boxes positions be the indexes of array and their values as array values. then if we select value at index 0, we cannot select value at index 1, but can select from index 2,3,, and so on.so we can apply Dynamic programming here.
F2F round 2 (Hiring Manager Round):
HR called me and gave me some tips before this Interview(I must say Amazon Interview people are really cool and make the candidate feel comfortable). He told me listen the question carefully and answer perfectly as this interview matter a lot.
1. Asked about my experience and work in current company. (Discussion lasted for about 1 hour) as I explained in deep and he asked cross questions.
2. Given 2 numbers, add them without using any arithmetic operator.
Hint : Use Binary Operators (specifically ‘<<‘, ‘&’, ‘^’)
Gave answers to this question and he was really impressed.
(he was also very cool in nature)
 
F2F Round 3 : 
1. Discussion on my projects and work in current company.
2. Given a general stack, design an advanced DS, such that getMin(),getMax() happens in o(1). Many cross questions on this. about optimizations and all.
Then HR told me that all my interviews went well and they will call me for last round of Interview. 🙂

Last F2F round (Bar Raiser):
1. Given a file having many lines of text(words) and given a dictionary having an API function boolean isValid(String word), which will return true is a word passed to this function is valid word in dic.,and will return false if given passed argument is not a valid word in dic.
Now read the file and check if each word as well as all possible words from its L to R and R to L combinations, are valid words in dic. or not.
e.g. say first line in file is “My name is Gourav”, then in the word NAME, the possible valid words are NAME, AM(L to R), ME(L to R), MAN(R to L), AN(R to L).
I implemented this simple questions in java code and used Hashmap to avoid processing of already processed words.
2. Why Amazon ?
3. Extraordinary work done in company which was out of scope of your designation.



I had around 1 year and 9 months of experience. And applied for SDE1
First Round (F2F):

Recently, I got a chance to be interviewed by Amazon at Bangalore campus, through referral. I had 8 months of experience in a product based company and 5 months of Internship. 
1st Round Telephonic : There were two guys, started with a formal introduction. Question 1 : Given an array and a number say “Num1”. Find two numbers whose sum is equal to given number “Num1”. 
I told him first Brute Force solution then he asked the time complexity which i told him O(n^2). Then he asked me to optimize the solution and I gave a O(nlogn) solution using sorting. And at last I told him O(n) solution using Hashing. 
Question 2 : Given an array of stock prices . Determine the maximum profit one can get by buying and selling the stock(Similar to stack span problem). I told him brute force solution of O(n^2) then he asked me if you could give an optimized solution. I told him O(n) solution using stack but code got stuck on some of the test cases and he asked me to modify the code but i couldn’t as they were running out of time. They provided me a link to Colabedit(kind of google shared document) where i had to code.Production ready code was required. After 2 days I got call from Amazon saying that feedback was positive and they asked me to come for face to face interview at Amazon’s office. 
F2F Round 1 : Started with a brief introduction. Q1: Given a M*N matrix. you have to start from Index(0,0) and reach to Index(M-1,N-1) with maximum sum , given the constraint that you can only move right or down i.e if you are at index (i,j), you can only move to index(i,j+1) or to index(i+1,j) I gave recursive solution for this and there were a lot of discussion on various test cases. He asked me to optimize the code. I gave him Dynamic programming approach . He asked that have you done it before and i said no then he asked me to code it. I had no idea of the code as i haven’t done it before. i struggled to write the correct code 2-3 times and at last i wrote the correct code. Then he said to me i am done with the interview, Do you have any question for me and i asked two question. 
Production ready code was required. 
F2F Round2 : Again Started with a brief introduction and some project discussion. Q1: A question similar to LCA(Least Common Ancestor) of Tree and I gave the answer immediately as I have understood the question and didn’t ask any further clarification. Q2: Given some resources in the form of the linked list you have to cancel out all the resources whose sum up to 0(Zero) and return the remaining list. I gave the solution immediately but couldn’t handle some of the corner test cases then he asked me to modify the code accordingly. Then he asked me to write all the test cases for it and i did. For eg; given the resources like this : case 1 : 6 -6 8 4 -12 9 8 -8 It should return 9 as all others get canceled. In the above example lists which gets canceled : 6 -6 8 4 -12 8 -8 o/p : 9 case 2 : 4 6 8 -9 10 -9 o/p : 4 6 case 3 : 4 6 -10 8 9 10 -19 10 -18 20 25 O/P : 20 25 
F2F Round3 : Started with a formal introduction and BTW he was the same guy who took my telephonic interview. Q1) He asked me subset sum problem i.e; Given an array find the maximum sum contiguous subarray. I gave O(n) a solution for finding the maximum sum immediately after he asked the question as I knew the solution. Then he asked me to trace the code for some test cases and it passed. Then he asked me to find the starting and end index of the subarray and I modified the code and initially got wrong but after some modification, I got the code right. 
Q2) Sum of numbers represented by two linked list. And I gave the answer immediately after he finished the question. But I gave the soln for adding two linked list numbers starting from the beginning but he told me to add the numbers as we do in normal addition. And I gave that solution by reversing the linked list and then adding the numbers and finally reversed the resultant list. After 2-3 days I got a call from Amazon that I have cleared the rounds and they asked me to come for Hiring Manager Round. One of the interviewers gave me feedback that he mugged the answer as I gave the answer immediately after the interviewer asked the question as I came to know later which was a major setback for me. So one of the advice would be to all of you that Even though you know the answer pretends that you don’t know. Ask some clarification question, As they also observe your problem-solving skills with coding. 
Hiring Manager Round F2F : Started with some basic questions and then asked why do you want to leave your current company and then he asked code Of the Fibonacci series. I explained the Fibonacci series and then he asked me to code it. I wrote the code and traced some inputs. Then he had a meeting as I reached late there so he asked me to improve the code as he said there is some bug in the code and I did. After that, he asked me to write recursive code for it. Then he asked the time complexity of the code and I said Exponential. Then he asked me to prove it. I said sir I could do it using Master Theorem or using Mathematical Induction. But right now I remember none of them. Then he told me that you can do it without Master Theorem or MI. Then in my mind, it struck me as the Recursion Tree Method but at that time I didn’t have any idea of the recursion tree method as well. So I couldn’t tell him. This round wasn’t positive as I knew right after my interview. I got eliminated after this round.

Telephonic 
Production level code in any language was expected with unit test. Collabedit link was shared before interview  
Face to Face Round 1  
He explained the code-reviews, deployment, testing etc practices followed at Amazon. He gave a brief background/goals of the team for which i applied. 
Round 2  
Round 3  
Round 4  
 
 


I was interviewed in Delhi for SDE-I position in Kindle Frameworks Team at Amazon. I was working as a Project Lead in Samsung, Noida and had a total experience of 1 year 10 months in the Software Industry.
Round 1 : Written
Round 2 : Problem Solving (F2F)
Round 3 : Design and Data Structures (F2F)
The interviewer was highly impressed with my coding skills and shook hands with a sense of approval.
Round 4 : Hiring Manager (F2F)
The Hiring Manager introduced himself and told me that I’ve been doing really great till now. Then he grinned at me and said “ Lets hope you don’t mess it up in this round “ .
(1) Which Sorting Algorithm is the fastest and why would you prefer it over others ?
While telling the answer, I said in between “ If there would have been millions of numbers…… “ and he caught that specific word of mine “millions” and hence the next 2 questions found the way on their own.
Then he stood up and shook my hands with a broad smile and said “ Well Done Man ! ” and left.
Round 5 : Bar Raiser (F2F)
All credit goes to  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ team for providing such an inspirational and a brilliant platform for coders. Keep it up guys, Way to go !
Suggestion for other candidates interviewing at Amazon :
 
 



Round 1
Round 2
Round 3

Round 4



Amazon Off Campus Interview Experience(SDE-1, Experienced)
Round 1:
1) Tell me about yourself.
2) Trapping Rain Water : Giv­en n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/trapping-rain-water/
3)  Print left view of a binary tree.
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/print-left-view-binary-tree/
	Discussion : I gave two approaches one with DFS and other with level order traversal.
He asked to compare two approaches and implement the efficient one. 	DFS is the efficient one because in level order, you need to store all the nodes at each level, some of them may not be a part of the left view of BT.
Round 2:
1) Tell me about yourself.
2)  Find sum of n elements after kth smallest element in BST. Tree is very large, you are             not allowed to traverse the tree.
	 Discussion : Since the array traversal is not allowed so we need to do some            preprocessing over the tree, something like storing sum of all its predecessor nodes.	 For finding kth smallest element, use order statistics approach:
 https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-k-th-smallest-element-in-bst-order-statistics-in-bst/
3)  Given a sorted array which has been rotated n number of times. Find the value of n.
	 It is similar to below post where you need to find only the pivot element. If you have the  Index of pivot element, you can get the number of times the array is rotated.
	 https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/search-an-element-in-a-sorted-and-pivoted-array/
Round 3:
1) Count ways to reach nth stair.
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/count-ways-reach-nth-stair/
	It is similar to fibonacci series. Interviewer asked various ways to implement the same –            Recursion, 1-D array, with 3 variables and complexity of each.
2)   Design recommendation engine.
	It’s like auto suggestion. I gave the trie approach. The interviewer seemed fine with         this approach and asked me to write full code with time and space complexities.	Implementation of Tries:
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/trie-insert-and-search/
Round 4 (Managerial Round – Over video call)
Tell me about yourself.
Current work
Which project you liked working the most.
Any case where you had conflict with your manager.
Any idea/technology suggested by you to your team which then got implemented and worked out.
Any case when you had to work out of your comfort zone.
The most critical feedback received from your manager/team members.
What do you do to enhance your technical knowledge apart from your project work.
    And many more.

Round 5(Final Round – Telephonic)
Initially I was asked questions about the work I had done, the projects I did and some managerial questions.
Then I was given a coding problem to solve. They use Collabedit tool in phone screen interviews where the same screen is shared by both interviewer and interviewee.
	Ques : Print all the non-repeating words out of two given sentences.
	Eg. Statement 1:   I have a blue pen.
	      Statement 2:   I got a red pen.
	      Output : have blue got red
	Discussion : I suggested the hashing approach. The interviewer asked to implement the same.

Points to take care:
You must know how to calculate time and space complexities.
In each round they ask you about the project you recently did/ the project you liked working most/ most challenging work etc –  so you should be prepared well for at least one project with in-depth details.
Start with the naive approach for each question asked and then proceed with solutions with better space and time complexities.
No need to waste time reading about Operating Systems, Networking, DBMS etc. They only care about the projects you did and your coding skills whether you cover all the edge cases while writing code, know time and space complexities, have better approaches for solving same problem and so on.



Round 1:
Discussion : I gave two approaches one with DFS and other with level order traversal.
He asked to compare two approaches and implement the efficient one. DFS is the efficient one because in level order, you need to store all the nodes at each level, some of them may not be a part of the left view of BT.
Round 2:
Round 3:
It is similar to fibonacci series. Interviewer asked various ways to implement the same -Recursion, 1-D array, with 3 variables and complexity of each.
Round 4(Managerial Round – Over video call)
Round 5(Final Round – Telephonic)
Points to take care:



I got a call from an consultant for recruitment drive in Delhi.
First round (1 hour 30 minutes): online writtenIt was online written round on a platform called Stockroom.io.
Expected time complexity is O(n). The only thing to pay attention was that ASCII characters starts from A.

Second round(1 hour): Design round  This was most critical and important round.
First HLD was required, use cases, flow diagram. then a low level design was required all necessary classes where will u use polymorphism, where inheritance, multithreading, synchronised approach if needed, socket connections. Other things that surfaced and he asked as interview goes : round robin load balancer, hash-map based load balancer, two layer caching, nosql db, design patterns, solid principles, ACID property, CAP theorem etc. Interviewer was a senior person and knew a lot. I was nervous in this round but answered well.
Third round (1 hour): technical
Fourth round (1 hour): technical He asked me what you like , I said array questions 🙂 He started laughing.
      he asked me to write code for the same. made some variations like lazy propagation.
Hr came and told me that we are done for the day one more interview is there which was on next day.
Hr was very supportive she gave me some constructive feedback and told me to get prepared well and come next day as next day was
with a Bar Raiser.
Fifth round (1 hour): technical+ design + behavioural, Bar Raiser
Few things to remember:



1st
2nd
3rd
No actual coding
4th
Bar raiser:
Hiring manager 1
Hiring manager 2 



Requirement was that the candidates should have strong troubleshooting skills, strong knowledge of scripting in any language + Strong coding skills and problem solving skills.

Write a script command to print the distinct records containing only alphanumeric characters.
Expected Output : 123456789X
[2 Marks]

Round 2 : Technical/Problem Solving F2F Interview
Then the interviewer asked me whether my code for the run length encoding asked in the written round will run for all the inputs. I was pretty sure that it would run. He gave me a case where my code was failing. He told me to modify my code. Also, I had used Hashing technique for this problem so he asked few questions on HashMap how it works.

Round 2: Debugging and Troubleshooting/Scripting
She modified the question and asked me if 3-4 customers complains the same that they are not able to login to their Amazon account, how will you troubleshoot the issue.
Debugging – How will you debug the issue whatever you have troubleshooted.

Round 4: Troubleshooting/Debugging/Problem Solving/ Managerial
At last, HR called me and told that I am rejected. 🙁



I applied off campus for Amazon Bangalore SDE-1. It started with two face to face rounds.
Face-2-Face (Round 1) :
Face-2-Face (Round 2):
He started introducing himself and then asked me some behavioural questions.
And then he asked me one dynamic programming question.
A matrix is given and each cell has some value. You can enter from any cell of first row and make three different moves down, south-east and south-west i.e. from (i,j) to (i+1,j+1), (i+1,j-1),(i+1,j). You need to calculate maximum value when you reach last row.
I gave recursive solution of complexity O(3^n) and then finally gave him dynamic programming solution in O(n^2). He was not done yet then he asked me to print the path as well. I did.
Both interviews were good so I was waiting for results. After 2 days I got the call you have cleared both the rounds and they want to conduct two more rounds. Next step was two more face-2-face rounds.
 Face-2-Face (Round 3):
It was a bar raiser round very crucial for the whole process. Interviewer introduced himself and asked me behavioural questions like:
I was currently working on Blockchain so he asked me about this technology cause its totally new and amazing tech so he was pretty impressed. He asked if I have any question for him. I asked several question related to his work and Amazon visions.

Face-2-Face (Round 4): Hiring manager round
This round was behavioural round and cultural fit. He asked so many questions related to projects and current work.
Then he asked me explain current company project and project architecture, my role in team etc. Guys prepare well for behavioural questions, they look for culture fit.
Coding question:
Print the vertical sum of a binary tree.
Result : I got the call after 3 days and hr said congratulations, you are placed and It was like dream came true.
Thanks to my parents, Upendra Bhaiya and Prajakta for all the support. I want to thank geeksforgeeks team, it’s an ideal platform for preparing coding interviews.



A big big thanks to geeks for geeks for constructing this platform where candidates find suitable question sets. 
1. 1st Round (Coding round on hacker rank) :
    Two questions. Each of 100 marks. Total time given was 2 hours.
    Question 1: Unit Area of largest region of 1’s 
    Question 2: Largest Sum Contiguous Subarray
2. 2nd Round (Tech) : 
    Two questions. Here the basic knowledge of data structures and algorithm is tested to determine whether candidate is eligible for onsite interview rounds or not.
    Question 1: Find zeroes to be flipped so that number of consecutive 1’s is maximized
    Question 2: A program to check if a binary tree is BST or not
3. 3rd Round (Tech):
    Two questions. Knowledge of algorithms and data structure was tested. Along with it, production level code had to be written on paper and it was to be made sure that no edge cases remain uncovered.
    Question 1: Print nodes at k distance from root
    Question 2: Print all nodes at distance k from a given node
4. 4th Round (Tech):
    Same checks as present in 3rd round. Since i did not perform well in the 2nd question of 3rd round, more stress on my coding part was given in this round. They were thoroughly checking my code and pointing all the edge cases if any.
    Question 1: Clone a linked list with next and random pointer 
    Question 2: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6179635/what-is-a-good-data-structure-for-storing-and-searching-2d-spatial-coordinates-i
5. 5th Round (Hiring Manager – Tech & Non Tech):
    Checks were same as above rounds. Along with those, whether the candidate was a good fit at amazon was checked. 
    Question 1: Given a stream of integers, at any point of time, fetch the count of integers which are smaller than a given number.  
    Question 2: HR Questions
     – give an instance where your manager and you disagreed.
     – give an instance where you outperformed yourself.
     – expiain your project and your role in it.
     – explain the most difficult project you’ve faced.
6. 6th Round (Bar raiser Tech and Non Tech) : 
     This guy will thoroughly check everything starting from code, algorithm, data structure, behavior etc. It is necessary of every candidate to crack this round. 
    Question 1:
    Given the below pattern, write a recursive code for all values of n. 
    Question 2:
    Explain internals of hash map’s put method and write code for it.
    Question 3: HR Questions
     – give an instance where your manager and you disagreed.
     – give an instance where you outperformed yourself.
     – expiain your project and your role in it.
     – explain the most difficult project you’ve faced.
Practices :

I went through some interview rounds for SDE-2 in amazon. Below is the format.
Round1:
Round2:
Round3:
Round4:



I went for face to face interview and faced following questions.



I recently got an interview call from Amazon (Chennai) for the Kindle team. Here is my experience:-
Round 1 – It was written round (Pen & Paper) consisting of three questions –
1. Run length encoding of a string.  Ex – Input – aaaabbcd  , Output – a4b2c1d1
2. Given a linked list consisting of characters. Determine if it is a palindrome or not?  O (1) space complexity.
3. Connect nodes at same level.  Check if Linked List is Palindrome
Out of 30 people, they shortlisted 6 of them for further rounds. I was one of them.
Round 2 (F2F) – It was purely based on programming standards:
1. Given a binary tree with two nodes, find the lowest common ancestor of them.
2. Adding to first ques, he further asked; find the minimum distance between any two nodes.
3. There is a conference room. N people are joining the conference. You have the start time and end time of each of them visiting it. You are asked to determine the maximum number of people that can be inside the room. 
Answer will be – 3
It went well. I was able to answer all of them. They asked me write production level code for each of them. Take care of all the end cases. Three out of six were able to make it.
Round 3 (F2F) – This round was grilling and was again on programming standards:
1. Print the top view of binary tree.
2. Find the maximum sum of any rectangle in a square matrix of n x n.
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming-set-27-max-sum-rectangle-in-a-2d-matrix/.
They provide you necessary hints whenever needed or if they feel you are not able to find a solution or thinking in a very wrong direction.
After this, they call me to Chennai for further two rounds of process.

Round 4 (Hiring Manager) – In this round, they focused on my experience and previous company’s work.
       All behavioral type of questions like:
1. How do you measure your success in the whole year?
2. Mention some of the negative and positive feedbacks from you manager.
3. Why you want to leave the firm so early? Why Amazon.
4. Questions on my projects and achievements in current company.
Hints: Just do not blame you current company as answer to any question. A clever way to deal this round is make them realize you are quite good for amazon.
P.S. Some research on Amazon before the interview would be great. 
Round 5 (Bar Raiser) – This was my final round. It was mixture of behavioral and coding.
Behavioral question were almost same what I mentioned above.
Discussions on my Final year project and what new I can add to it if I am given a chance to improvise it.
Some coding questions:
1. Given two strings, find the uncommon characters in them using single hash map.
2. Given data of millions of people, (name, age, M/F etc.) Develop an API that will have age range as input and yield the count of people under this range as output.
Thanks Geeksforgeeks for all the references. You people are doing great!
Key points:
1. Just write clean and crisp code, whenever asked to code considering the end cases.
2. Maintain continuous discussions with interviewer. He/She will help you whenever needed.



I went through some interview rounds for SDE-2 in amazon. Below is the format.
Round1: It was a test on HackerEarth with two programming questions
Round 2:
Write production ready code. Consider scenario for duplicates too.

Round 3:



Attended two interview rounds for SDE II position. Rejected after second round.
Round 1 : Q1 – Design spelling checker web service.
Round 2 : Q1 – Design cricket scoreboard.


Some time back I went through an interview for Amazon.com for SDE-1 role, and here is my experience to help other aspirants :
Written – Pen & Paper Rounds
Had to write production level code in any programming language of my choice, covering all the edge cases, and clearly mentioning the complexity of my code.
Solution: GeeksforGeeks Link
Solved it using Binary search tree

Face to Face Rounds?
Interviewers were very very helpful, and were focused on approach, they will ask basic brute force solution first, then an optimum solution, after that they may increase the complexity of problem a little bit, and if you are able to explain your approach satisfactorily, then will ask you to write production level code in any programming language of your choice, covering all edge cases using pen and paper : 
Advice to fellow members preparing for something like Amazon : 
I hope this information will be helpful to all of you, wish you all the very very best.

Onsite interview


Round 1 (45 Mins)
Brief description of the current project: Architecture, Technologies, Workflow etc.
Round 2 (50 Mins)
Solution: GeeksforGeeks Link
He asked questions like most challenging task you did in your past experience, I explained him about middlewares I implemented earlier for tracking the exceptions in code.

Round 3 (written)
    I was called in Amazon office after few days (very nice office)
I believe this round was just for warmup.
Round 4 (45 Mins)
Brief description of current project: this time he was more focused on technologies and tools. He asked every technology I mentioned in deep.
Queries would be like: GET name, so output would be Pratik. (something like that)

I applied through recruiter, i was having 4 year exp while appearing for this interview, overall it was quite lengthy process.
I shared my resume to recruiter and later was scheduled a telephonic discussion
Telephonic Round 1:
Brief Intro from both the side then he asked the technical question,
Then there was gap of almost 3 weeks with no clue on feedback then suddenly recruiter contacted me stating the positive feedback from telephonic discussion and invite for In House interview at Amazon Gurgaon office since i was in NCR region.
Round 2:
This was completely technical round, i was asked to three technical question, not much tough
Round 3:
This was kind of mix of technical and some behavioral questions
Initially interview asked some of the questions from resume then jumped to the technical questions,
Round 4:
This round was completely design round (LLD and HLD)
Design Debugger then in between he moved to design Meeting scheduler
In last 10 minute he asked me to give HLD of Clock Room
Round 5:
This was taken by some senior developer,
He asked few question related to previous work, its challenges then moved to technical question
Then again some behavioral question,
This type of questions.
These all rounds happen on the same day, then i was asked to leave for the day and wait till next week for getting the feedback and next steps if any.
After 1 week, i got mail stating that, we would like to proceed further and scheduled my bar raiser round.
Round 6 (BR):
It was telephonic discussion,
Interviewer judged me on Amazon leadership principles,
And i believe i just slips on one of the principle but overall he was satisfied with my responses.
And he asked me to explain HLD for Automatic Parking System.
This interview stretched for long since there was some network connectivity issue with my cell network,
In last he asked me to explain just the approach of solving a technical problem,
Exact question i don’t remember but it was related to merging k sorted array.
Round 7 (HM):
Nearly next week this interview was scheduled since Hiring mangers were not available due to their busy schedule,
Majority of the time this interview was around behavioral questions and Amazon leadership principles.
In last he asked me to design Game Studio like amoeba game zone.
                                         




Round 1: Telephonic round.
Round 2:

After 1 month recruiter called for f2f rounds. There were 4 rounds on the same day.
Round 1: Hiring Manager Round (Behaviour + Design)(1.5 Hrs)
Intro, Project & Lot of Behaviour Questions
Lot of other behaviour questions. Finally gave a design problem to solve.
Design:
Do integration for Splitwise app with Amazon Pay (or Paytm)
1) where a person can pay to another person and money directly gets deposited into other person’s bank account.
2) A person can also send reminder to another person for owning money.
Round 2: Design Round (1.5 Hrs)
Round 3: Coding Round (1.5 Hrs)
GeeksforGeeks Link

Round 4: Coding Round (1.5 Hrs)
First write the data structure to solve this problem, then efficient algorithm, then complete working code on paper.

 
Overall it was a positive experience, recruiter kept me informed about the progress and about next rounds. First four rounds went well but I wasn’t able to solve 5th round problem, and was eliminated after then.
Thanks a lot to geeks for geeks for having such a great amount of collection to practice on.
 
Advise:
 


It was a recruitment drive at Pune, for Kindle team (Chennai).
Round 1 (Screening):
Two common questions were given to all. We’re supposed to discuss the approach to the problem with the interviewer first and then implement it after the interviewer is convinced with your approach.
Round 2 (Problem Solving):
Round 3 (Problem Solving):
Round 4 (Design):
Round 5 (Bar raiser):
Few questions to evaluate me on Amazon’s leadership principles.  I can’t remember them all 🙁
And one algorithmic problem at the end. Diameter of a binary tree
Round 6 (Hiring manager):
Note:  In problem solving rounds, you’re supposed to write a working code in any language of your choice, handling all the corner cases.
Finally got an offer after 3 days!! 🙂 All the best!! (y)

I was interviewed for customer returns team for Hyderabad campus. I had 1 year and 9 month experience at the time of getting interviewed. Less experience was something which was worrying me a lot. They generally ask for 3-5 years of experience, but come down to 2 years if you are good.
1. What is so special about typescript that both Angular and React included it in the recent versions. Tsc compiler, final output, difference between java, JS and TS were discussed. Any live project use case where TS helped more than JS (I come from a pure JS background that’s why this question was asked)
2. Design a vending machine with following functionalities
Both HLD and LLD were expected.
Round 2 to 6 were done in Amazon Hyderabad campus. All interviews were back to back. It started from 11 AM to 5:30 PM with just half an hour lunch break. Before I could even step out after completing one round, other interviewers would already be waiting outside. Interviewers were very helping, but only if your are thinking in the right direction. HR also was very supportive. He was coming and motivating me after every round. Some advices here
 


Round 1: Telephonic Round 
 
Round 2: Face to Face interview 
Round 3: Face to Face interview 
It was not a coding question only. He expected me to write a Heap interface and using that implement min heap or max heap. And also write the heapify code


Round 1:
Round 2:
Round 3:
Design round:
Round 4: 
Managerial round, lot of project and Amazon’s leadership principle related questions.
Round 5:
Bar Raiser: Lot of behavioral and leadership principle questions, then asked a design question, design a load balancer’s algorithm so that it redirects the traffic between three services s1, s2, s3 by 50%, 30% and 20%. further clause added to handle various clients calling to specific services.
 
Tips for the interview:  Good hands on towards problem solving and algorithm, HLD and LLD,   prepare well for Amazon’s leadership principles.

After a few days I got a call saying I was selected 🙂


This interview was for the SDE-2 position for logistic management department of amazon. I had applied for this job on naukari.com.
Round 1:

There was an online codding test on Hackerearth. Two questions were asked. I don’t remember them now.
Round 2:
After two weeks they scheduled a telephonic round.
Question 1: Given a matrix of ‘0’ and ‘1’, find the largest Iceland (i.e area of  ‘1’s)
Question 2. Design a data structure with constant time for insert, delete, search and getRandom.
I had given solutions for the both.
Round 3 :
This was onsite interview at Hyderabad.
First he asked about my past projects and challenges faced. He then asked if I had designed anything on top of current a system.
Next a technical question was given;
Given an array of integers  and a window size ‘k’, find first negative number for each possible window in the array.
I first gave him a two queue approach(was not optimal), he told to code it on paper. After I wrote the code, he asked to optimize it further. Finally after few iterations, I gave him an optimal two pointer approach.
My suggestion here is; do not hurry to present your solution to interviewer,   first try to come-up with best optimal solution. For SDE-2 positions they expect optimal solution at the very first place from you.
Round 4 :
This was all project and HLD related round.
There were two interviewers. The first introduced themselves and told about what their group does at amazon.
He then asked about my role at previous company and past projects I did in brief. Then asked if I have done something like adding new functionality or suggested some improvement for the project that was not asked by customer or manager.
He then asked me to draw HLD for meeting calendar system. Then there was discussion on various issues on it like scalability, what database should be used; SQL-NoSQL, concurrency etc.
 
All the best guys!


Amazon visited our campus(DAIICT) to recruit interns and FTEs. I’m sharing my internship interview experience.
There were 2 rounds in all – 1 Online Round followed by 1 F2F Interview.
Online Round(90 min ):
There were 24 questions based on Logical Reasoning, 7 questions based on Debugging and 2 questions of coding.
The 2 coding questions were:
Out of around 250 students, 53 were shortlisted for Round 2.
->Doing MCQ (Logical Reasoning) was important. Few students who solved both the coding question but didn’t attempt the MCQs were not selected while some who could solve 80% of 1 question(8/10 test cases) and few MCQs were selected.
Round 2: FTF Interview (Around 90 mins):
The interviewer asked me some HR questions like Why Amazon? , Introduce myself 
Reverse every k node. 
Then he asked me a question on the graph. I told him that I have not prepared for it, but I had a course called design and analysis in my semester 3 so I will try to recall that and try to answer your question. 1) given n cities and every city is connected via m roads. There is no cycle in the graph. Each road between city x and city y has some traffic denoted by weight of the edge. Each city has one stadium. Now suppose in one city, a cricket match is conducted and all other cities’ people come to that city to watch a match. Total traffic denoted by the sum of edges of all city. The task is to find maximum traffic coming to that city at any point in time.

Suppose the match is in the city coloured with black. So traffic coming to that is from 3 sides.  one from the group of three cities and traffic will be (9+5+4+2 = 20), second will be from (15 + 6= 21) and third will be(1+4=5). so ans will be max of these and thus ans = 21.
When he gave me this question I don’t know the answer but I tried a lot. I gave him around 3 approaches and discussed with the interviewer but he said that my approach is wrong. But then I tried and never give up. Then he gave me the hint to do bfs and then dfs from neighbouring. I got a hint and answered the question and wrote code. Then, he asked me if I had any questions for him.
Out of the 53 selected for the interviews, 13 were finally selected for the internship.
Verdict: Selected.
Tips :
During my preparation geeks for geeks, indeed, was a great help. Almost all the questions asked in the interview were from geeks. A big thank you to other geeks as well for sharing their interview experiences as going through past experiences was the perfect way to end my preparations.
