How hash map work internally explain on board.


How you make it double ton(in even call of getInstance() first object should be return and odd call of getInstance() second instance should be return).


How load factor works in HashMap.


How will you store key value pair in sorted way based on values.


How will you break TreeSet property (it should store Objects in non sorted order)


Why are you using SOAP why not Restful.


Why are you using SAX why not DOM.


What is Agile.


What is your role.


Explained me about GS how they work in GS and all.


Round 1:
After asking for a brief intro, the interviewer started by asking Java questions which were: OOPs concepts of Java, what is runtime polymorphism, overloading/overriding, how many collections you have used in Java, how does Hashmap works, what is a contract between equals and hashcode?


:P)
Round 2:
Here too, the interviewer started by asking java questions: What is the difference between string, string buffer and string builder, what does final keyword do, when can final variable value be changed, what is classpath in java?


The question was like: How many total constituencies are there?


Which all candidates are contesting?


Which candidate represents which party?


How many male/female candidates won and with how many votes?


Question:


So if I give you the opportunity to go first, which move you’ll start with to ensure victory?
After this, some discussion happened on GS and its workings.

How did you handle it and the conclusion?

output all the ways in which these two strings can be merged while keeping the order of character same as they were in s1, s2.


How a hashmap is implemented internally in JAVA.


How will you store these records and then fetch them.


How to maintain the whole structure when a file was modified.


How shall they provide the record, how should company C release its application.


How can you make your system learn about the 100 customers, so that the cost of validation can be reduced.


He changed errors to warnings then, said, Developers many times ignore them, but can they be of any use?
