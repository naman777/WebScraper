Round 1: two written questions
– https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/candies/problem
– Check if a binary tree is subtree of another binary tree 

Round 2: F2F
 discussion of above 2 questions and
– Maximum Product Subarray
– Bottom View of Binary Tree
Round 3: F2F
– Given n numbers having k unique numbers and rest repeated where k<<n, sort them in time complexity less than O(nlogn)
– Sort array having numbers 1, 2, 3 only
– One thread (for printing 1, 100 times) vs 10 threads ( each printing 1, 10 times), which one is better and why ?
